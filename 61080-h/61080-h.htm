SO reticent was Miss Manning
in her lifetime, and
so loyally have her wishes
been obeyed by her kindred
since her death, that
when Mr. Nimmo last year re-published
her beautiful memorial portrait, “The
Household of Sir Thomas More,” it was
clear that whatever of her personal history
had ever been known had been already
forgotten. She had indeed been confused,
in a Biographical Dictionary, with
another writer: it even needed the
assurance of her surviving niece to convince
inquirers that she lived and died
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>unmarried. Thus to live and die, “the
world forgetting, by the world forgot,”
was what the gentle spirit chose. To
be known through her books, and loved,
there can be little question, was her
ambition, and it was a wish which I
cannot doubt is fulfilled. The “author
of ‘Mary Powell,’” as she styled herself
on her title-pages, has left several exquisite
little studies, highly appreciated when
they first saw the light, and still worthy,
as it seems to me, of that kind of immortality
of regard which is won by those
writers whom none of us would place in
the first rank of Literature, but whom all
who know them remember with something
of a personal affection. When I
say that Miss Manning reminds me of
Miss Rossetti, I do not mean that the
earlier writer has the genius of the most
perfect poet that ever, in the English
tongue, linked the highest aspirations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>Religion with the most exquisite expressions
of Poetry; but rather that their
minds were both beautiful, their experiences
pathetic, their hearts true. They
would walk together in Paradise, and
understand each other: when our Lady
of Sorrows sings “Magnificat,” they would
stand by, and their souls would echo to
her song. The matter of the work of
each is very different, yet in the manner
there is something indescribably akin.
Christina Rossetti is one of the greatest
writers of the century; but, unique though
she is, and unapproachable in her sphere,
in the land below her the author of
“Mary Powell” has thought some of
the same thoughts, and thought them in
the same way.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O my soul, she beats her wings,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And pants to fly away</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Up to immortal things</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In the heavenly day:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Yet she flags and almost faints;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Before God and the Lamb.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Come and taste My sweets, saith Jesus:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Be with Me where I am.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The voice is that of Christina Rossetti,
but it is the thought too of her who
wrote “Cherry and Violet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Manning, as we read her life in
her books, walks through the world with
an unbounded charity and a hope ever
refreshed. “Preach peace to all,” said
S. Francis of Assisi, “for often those
whom you think to be the children of
the devil are those whom you will
know some day to be the sons of God.”
Miss Manning loved to think of, and
to look upon, whatsoever things are
lovely and of good report, and so thinking
and looking she found flowers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>everywhere to spring up beneath her
feet.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tread softly! all the earth is holy ground.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It may be, could we look with seeing eyes,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This spot we stand on is a Paradise</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where dead have come to life and lost been found,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where faith has triumphed, martyrdom been crowned,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From this same spot the dust of saints may rise,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the King’s prisoners come to light unbound.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>So when she turns to the sixteenth
century, with its sordid materialism and
its coarse handling of things most sacred,
not merely does she recognise, as an
Englishwoman, the grandeur of its struggles,
but she sees its best embodiment in
the tragedy of an almost perfect life. As
she seeks refuge in that time of stress with
the Household of Sir Thomas More, so
in the next century she turns aside from
the pettiness of Pepys or the realism of
Defoe to the life of a simple girl born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>and nurtured on the great bridge that
spans the Thames.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Quali colombe dal disio chiamante</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Con l’ali aperte e ferme al dolce nido</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Volan per l’aer dal voler portate.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With “The Household of Sir Thomas
More” we walked in the dangerous days
when the Lion found his strength. With
“Cherry and Violet” we are in the still
more alarming atmosphere of the Commonwealth
and the Restoration. Year
by year, as old houses open their chests,
and scholars hunt among their yellow
papers, we learn more of the reign of
terror which marked the closing years of
the Protectorate. We see one Verney
living a “lude life” with “my lord
Claypoll” and other “my lords” the
kindred of the Protector; while another,
the honest Sir Ralph, stoutest of Parliamentarians,
is clapped in prison, no man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>knows why; and at the same time John
Howe, pious Puritan preacher (whom
Mistress Cherry herself knew of), is confessing
how impossible it is to win the
family which reigns at Whitehall to think
of the welfare of their souls. Yet all
the while there hangs over the land the
outer gloom of an enforced conformity,
which Miss Manning so happily describes.
When we find ourselves in the
heyday of the Restoration, or when we
watch the splendours and the scandals of
the Court of Charles II., we learn from
the scandalous Pepys—now so much more
than ever since Mr. H. B. Wheatley has
given us all that it was possible to print
of the wonderful Diary as Pepys really
wrote it—how utterly rotten was the
social life of the age, even among those,
too often, who might seem to sit sedately
above its more flagrant iniquities.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then there comes in Defoe with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>his marvellous photographic realism of
fiction, and tells us of the horrors of the
Plague with a fidelity which those who
had lived among them could, we fancy,
hardly have approached.</p>

<p class='c013'>From sources such as these—from
Pepys and Defoe, as well as from the
more sober pages of the stately Evelyn,
it is that Miss Manning takes much of
the <i>mise-en-scène</i> of her “Tale of the
Great Plague”; and we find, as historic
evidence accumulates around us, how
true her imaginary picture is.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a happy thought which made
the story begin on old London Bridge—happier
still, readers will now think when
they see Mr. Herbert Railton’s beautiful
drawings. Something we learn of the
stress of the time as we recall, with
Mistress Cherry, the strange pageants
which the bridge-dwellers watched from
their windows. They saw the double
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>tide, portent of unknown woes. They
saw how the mighty Strafford went
serenely to his death, and the old Archbishop
passed up and down under guard
on the long days of his weary trial. They
saw the King come to his own again—and
some of them may have looked out
of windows that wet Sunday night in
1662 when Mr. Pepys had left his singing
of “some holy things” and went
back by water, shooting the rapids under
“the bridge (which did trouble me)
home, and so to bed.” The life on the
bridge must have been something which
an Englishman’s experience of to-day can
hardly help to picture. Something of it
we may fancy as we enter an old shop on
the Ponte Vecchio at Florence, or look
out upon it and the Arno from the long
corridor that connects the Uffizi with
the Pitti. But on that narrow space is
no such crowded life as on old London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>Bridge—no such dangers for foot-passengers,
drivers, and horsemen. To picture
this in seventeenth-century England we
must cross near mid-day from Stamboul
towards Pera by the far-famed Galata
Bridge. Scarce anywhere but in Florence
and in Constantinople can we now recall
what sights old London Bridge must
have witnessed. Mr. Railton sees them,
though, very clearly, and we are more
than content to see with his eyes. Something
idealised they are, perhaps. Old
London Bridge was hardly so beautiful,
surely, as he pictures it; and his drawings,
perhaps, are more like what the
houses ought to have been than ever
they were. “More Nurembergy than
Nuremberg,” says Mr. Ruskin of some
of Prout’s famous work. We may say it
of Mr. Railton’s old London; and high
praise it is. And as Mr. Railton brings
back to us the scenes, so Mr. Jellicoe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>gives us the persons of old time in their
habits as they lived.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among such surroundings we picture
Cherry doing her simple duties, tending
her mother, thinking somewhat primly
of her vivacious neighbour Violet, fancying
she has lost her heart for ever to poor
Mark, and then waking to a heroine’s
work in the horrors of the Plague, and
finding through that her own bright
reward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Plague growing on us,” says
Pepys, and of remedies “some saying one
thing, and some another.” So it begins
in May, and by the first week of June,
“much against my will, I did in Drury
Lane see two or three houses marked
with a red cross upon the doors, and
‘Lord have mercy upon us’ writ there;
which was a sad sight to me, being the
first of the kind that to my remembrance
I ever saw.” Ten days later, and as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>goes in a hackney coach from the Lord
Treasurer’s, his coachman is struck of a
sudden “very sick and almost blind”—and
journey by coach becomes “a very dangerous
passage nowadays.” So it comes
till there are seven hundred dying in a
week, and “it was a sad noise to hear our
bell to toll and ring so often either for
death or burials.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And soon, “But, Lord! how sad a
sight it is to see the streets empty of
people and very few upon the ’Change.
Jealous of every door that one sees shut
up, lest it should be the Plague; and
about us two shops in three, if not more,
generally shut up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Reports are terrible of the thousands
who every week are carried to their
graves in the long pits; and with an
even closer terror speaks the record of
the veracious diarist. “I went forth and
walked towards Moorfields (August 30th)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>to see (God forgive me my presumption!)
whether I could see any dead corpse
going to the grave; but, as God would
have it, did not. But, Lord! how everybody
looks, and discourse on the streets
is of death, and nothing else, and few
people going up and down, that the town
is like a place distressed and forsaken.”
“What a sad time it is,” he writes on
20th September, “to see no boats upon
the river; and grass grows up and down
White Hall Court, and nobody but poor
wretches in the streets.”</p>

<p class='c013'>To these records the genius of Defoe
adds an immortal picture. “As this puts
me upon mentioning my walking the
Streets and Fields”—he has been speaking
of the numbers that fled to the outskirts
of the town, “into the Fields and Woods,
and into secret uncouth Places, almost
anywhere to creep into a Bush, or Hedge,
and die,” and how it “was a general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>Method to walk away” if any one was
seen coming—“I cannot omit taking
notice what a desolate place the City
was at that time. The great street I
lived in, which is known to be one of
the broadest of all the streets of London,
I mean of the Suburbs as well as the
Liberties; all the side where the Butchers
lived, especially without the Bars, was
more like a green Field than a paved
Street, and the People generally went in
the middle with the Horses and Carts.
It is true that the farthest End, towards
White-Chappel Church, was not all pav’d,
but even the part that was pav’d was full
of Grass also; but this need not seem
strange, since the great Streets within the
City, such as Leaden-Hall Street, Bishopgate-Street,
Cornhill, and even the Exchange
itself, had Grass growing in them,
in several Places; neither Cart nor Coach
were seen in the Streets from Morning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>Evening, except some Country Carts to
bring Roots and Beans, or Pease, Hay
and Straw, to the Market, and those but
very few, compared to what was usual:
as for Coaches, they were scarce used, but
to carry sick People to the Pest-House,
and to other Hospitals; and some few to
carry Physicians to such Places as they
thought fit to venture to visit; for really
coaches were dangerous things, and People
did not Care to venture into them because
they did not know who might have been
carried in them last; and sick infected
People were, as I have said, ordinarily
carried in them to the Pest-Houses, and
some times People expired in them as
they went along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is true, when the Infection came
to such a Height as I have now mentioned,
there were very few Physicians
which car’d to stir abroad to sick Houses,
and very many of the most eminent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>the Faculty were dead as well as the
Surgeons also; for now it was indeed a
dismal time, and for about a month together,
not taking any Notice of the Bills
of Mortality, I believe there did not die
less than 1500 or 1700 a-Day, one Day
with another.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One of the worst Days we had in the
whole Time, as I thought, was in the
Beginning of September, when indeed
good People began to think that God
was resolved to make a full End of the
People in this miserable City. This was
at that Time when the Plague was fully
come into the Eastern Parishes: the
Parish of Algate, if I may give my
Opinion, buried above a thousand a Week
for two Weeks, though the Bills did not
say so many; but it surrounded me at so
dismal a rate, that there was not a House
in twenty uninfected; in the Minories,
in Houndsditch, and in those Parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>Algate about the Butcher-Row, and the
Alleys over against me, I say in those
places Death reigned in every Corner.
White-Chappel Parish was in the same
Condition, and tho’ much less than the
Parish I liv’d in; yet buried near 600 a
Week by the Bills; and in my Opinion
near twice as many; whole Families, and
indeed whole Streets of Families were
swept away together; insomuch that it
was frequent for Neighbours to call to
the Bellman, to go to such and such
Houses, and fetch out the People, for
that they were all dead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There is little, if anything, in the description
which is exaggerated. How
much in tone as well as detail Miss
Manning learnt from this great master
of fiction is clear. But it was altogether
foreign to her nature to paint long in
such gloomy colours, and she turned,
with a true art, from the horrors of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>Plague to the peace of country life “in
good King Charles’s golden days.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So she brings her heroine down into
Berkshire. A very short journey we
take it to have been, or the old horse
must have been more swift of foot than
we should gather from Mistress Cherry’s
description, for Buckland in Berks lies
not far from Faringdon, and over seventy
miles from London town. One of those
quiet little villages it is that nestle among
the low hills that overlook the peaceful
valley of the upper Thames. A fine old
church may have had Master Blower
for its vicar. It has four bells and a
register that date from his day. There
are memorials of two families, the Yates
and the Southbys, who have passed away
with the good old times. The house is
not such as Mistress Cherry stayed in, but
speaks all of the eighteenth century, of
George the Second and Mr. Wood of Bath.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>It is tempting to wonder whether this
part of the country was one Miss Manning
ever saw—whether she watched the
deer speeding by her—whether she felt
the fascination of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This little stream whose hamlets scarce have names,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>This far-off, lonely mother of the Thames.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>One may like to fancy her rejoicing in it,
as Dante Gabriel Rossetti rejoiced, who
lived in a quaint old house such as she
had pictured Master Blower welcoming
Cherry into, only a few miles away from
Buckland, at Kelmscott. But the place
refuses to be identified, and we must be
content to conclude that Mistress Cherry’s
geography was at fault.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having chosen a striking setting for
her characters, Miss Manning knew well
how to give them life. She had a quiet
humour, and a kindly knowledge of
human nature, which made her draw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>true portraits. Different readers will have
their favourites, but I think few will fail
to be drawn to honest Nathaniel Blower,
priest and scholar, who, after days of
poverty such as we may read many a true
history of in Walker’s “Sufferings of the
Clergy,” and a sore struggle with the
Plague, lived to be Rector of Whitechapel,
and better still, after the crowning
misfortune of the Fire, to end his days
quietly among the country folk at Bucklands
with his good wife by his side.
Master Blower is indeed drawn with Miss
Manning’s happiest touches: we do not
readily forget the figure he presents in
bed, or how he “in his Deliration went
through the whole Book of Job in his
head.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whether most lads would not fall in
love with Violet we cannot tell, but certainly
quiet Cherry is a good woman,
worthy of the hand of Mary Wilkins.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>We may sometimes feel that she is a
damsel of the nineteenth century at masquerade
in the dress of two centuries
before; but we like her none the less if
we fancy she is good Miss Manning in
disguise.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so we leave her and Master
Blower happy in their home at Bucklands.
Good man, we doubt not he
tilled his garden and tended his parish
well, like the Berkshire priest and poet
of to-day, and, it may be, with the same
thought.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In all my borders I my true love seek</div>
      <div class='line in6'>By flowery signs to set:</div>

  </div>

I&nbsp;WONDER whether many
People, on reviewing their
past Lives, feel as I do
on looking back on mine;
that, had they had the
ordering the outward Circumstances connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>with them beforehand, such as
Time, Place, Health, Sickness, Friends,
Acquaintances, and such-like Conditions,
they could not have arranged them half so
well as they have been disposed for them.
When I fall into a Muse on the Past, the
Moments fly so swiftly that I am lost in
Amazement when I find how the Time
has slipped by while thus pleasantly employed.
And yet many of the Arrangements
which were made for me by a
greater Wisdom than mine, were such as
at the Time were far from agreeable to
me; nay, were sometimes so repugnant
to Flesh and Blood as to nourish rebellious
Thoughts, and call forth Showers of Tears.
And still the Process went on; as I now
see, all for my Good.</p>

<p class='c013'>My Father married my Mother in the
Spring of the Year 1632: being then in
the Prime of Life, a personable, charming-looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Man, though small of Stature,
and with a Nose somewhat awry. In his
Conditions he was ever most lovely; of a
sweet Temper, shrewd Observance, stout
Heart, and lively Wit. Many, no Doubt,
had read more, by reason of their Opportunities;
but what few Books he knew,
he turned to Profit, and perhaps no Man
concocted his Reading into Judgment
better than he; by which he became so
judicious and oracular, as that though he
could not indeed prophesy, he could presage;
and some of his Presages came true
and others not, but might have done so,
had Events taken but in a very slight
Degree a different Course. He knew
how to sound his Customers, and suck
the Marrow of their Knowledge, while
keeping his own Counsel: but this was
his Prudence, not Pusillanimity, for I
have heard it remarked by one who knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>him well, that the <i>Trojan</i> Horse was not
more full of Valour than he, for so small
a Man. Being a Hair-dresser, this was
not so evident in him as if he had been
a Soldier; but yet every Man’s Life
affords Occasions, as my Father’s certainly
did, of showing what is in him and what
is not.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Dress, his Taste was excessive neat,
and yet gaudy; so that on <i>Sundays</i>, when
he appeared in what he called his Marigold-and-Poppy,
with his Hair, which
Men then wore very long, combed down
in large smooth Curls, his laced Collar
nicely ironed, his Beaver well brushed,
and his Shoes shining like Coals ... it
would have been difficult to find a Grain
of Fault with him, save that, as my Cousin
<i>Mark</i> was wont to say, the Colours of his
Suit did too much swear at one another.
For my own Part, I always had an Impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>that he was an excessive well-looking
Man, not out of any Prejudice,
but downright Prepossession; and yet my
dear Mother, who I am sure loved him
truly, always said to me when I alluded
to the Subject, “My Dear, the Qualities
of his Person were always far exceeded
by those of his Mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of my Cousin <i>Mark</i>, who was my
Father’s Apprentice, there could not be
two Opinions. He was winsome, lightsome,
debonair; of most comely Person
and Aspect: we were all very proud of
him, and he of himself. If he had a
Fault, it was thinking too much of himself
and too little of others; but this is so
common that I do not know I am justified
in particularizing it. Also he was somewhat
of a Coward, not in respect of personal,
animal Courage, of which I suppose
he had as much as the aforesaid <i>Trojan</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Horse, whatever that might be; but
morally cowardly, as to what would be
thought of him by others, and dreading
the Evil of the present Moment, and so
forth; which Men don’t think so bad a
kind of Cowardice as the other, but I do.</p>

<p class='c013'>But his Temper was most sweet: his
Manners most engaging. Oh! how
much he came to be thought of, at length,
all along the Bridge! I have no other
Fault to find in him besides those already
reckoned; unless it were a general Want
of Principle, which was less apparent than
it would have been, had it not been
covered rather than supplied by good
Feeling. But ’tis ill reckoning the Faults
of one’s Friends.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of my Mother, how shall I say enough?
She was tall, slender, and comely to look
upon, with sweet and quick grey Eyes.
She was naturally of a high Spirit, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>had been brought under a Curb by Divine
Grace. She was kind and obliging to all,
stirring and thrifty, yet not niggardly;
soft-hearted to the Poor, of wonderful
Propriety without the least Priggishness,
loved by her Friends, and especially in
her own Family. Now I have counted
up the whole House except our Lodger,
Master <i>Blower</i>, and <i>Dolly</i>, the Cook.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>My Father’s shop was on the east side of London Bridge</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>My Father’s Shop was on the east Side
of <i>London Bridge</i>. Over his Door hung
his Sign of “<i>The Lock of Hair</i>;” and over
the Shop-front was painted in yellow
Letters the following Inscription,—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Peter Curling</span> <i>sells all Sorts of Hair, Curled
or Uncurled, Roses, Braids, Cauls, Ribbons,
Weaving, Sewing-silk, Cards, and Blocks.
Together with Combs, Crisping-pins, Perfumery,
and all other Goods made use of by
Tonsors and Hairdressers, at the Lowest
Prices</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>On the opposite Side of the Way, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>a Vintner’s, by the Name of <i>Abel</i>, who
had humorously set up <i>a Bell</i> for his Sign,
and painted beneath it, “Quoth the Wag,
I am <i>Abel</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Next Door to us on one Side, lived a
Bookseller and Stationer named <i>Benskin</i>,
whose Sign was the Bible and Star; and
next Door to us on the other Side was
a Glover named <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i>, a jolly,
good-tempered Bachelor, black-haired,
fresh-coloured, and six Feet high, whose
Sign was the Roebuck.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few Weeks after my Birth, which
was in <i>February, 1633</i>, in the Midst of
a notable hard Frost, there broke out a
most dreadful Fire at the north End of
the Bridge, which consumed all the
Houses on both Sides, from <i>St. Magnus’</i>
Church to the first open Space on the
Bridge. There was, I have heard tell,
much bodily Hurt as well as Destruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of Property; many Persons in precipitating
themselves from upper Stories, getting
their Limbs broken. “Water! Water!”
was the Cry, and all in vain, for though
the <i>Thames</i> lay right under the Houses,
’twas one great Cake of Ice, and the only
Resource was to break the Conduit Pipes
that ran through the Streets leading to
the Bridge, and sweep the Water down
with Brooms, to supply the three Engines
that every one had thought would be such
Helps in Time of Need, but which proved
very sorry Helps indeed. In the Midst
of the Tumult and Danger, some Neighbours
of ours that were burned out of
House and Home, took Refuge with us;
to wit, the Wife and infant Daughter of
Master <i>Samuel Armytage</i>, Haberdasher of
small Wares; the Infant being, like myself,
a Nursling of only a few Weeks old.
These homeless Strangers did my Mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>hospitably and Christianly entertain, bestirring
herself more in her Care for them
than in her tender Case it was fit she
should have done, and putting us two
Infants into one and the same Cradle.
With our little Arms locked about one
another, in an Atmosphere of Christian
Love, ’twas no Wonder that little <i>Violet</i>
and I conceived a Tenderness for each
other, e’en while Sucklings, that grew
with our Growth, and strengthened with
our Strength. As for the elder Parties,
Hospitality on the one Side and Thankfulness
on the other caused a more than
common Friendliness to spring up between
them from that Time forth. And when
the Fugitives were re-established in their
re-built Houses, they long had an impressive
and solemnifying Remembrance
of their narrow Escape from an awful
and terrible Death.</p>

<div id='i010'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Now, though I cannot, of course, remember
Anything of the Fire, I have a
perfect Recollection of the next notable
Occurrence among us, of <i>the Double Tide</i>,
which happened in my eighth Year; and
how the River, after lying as still as a
Stone for more than an Hour, suddenly
came foaming up from <i>Greenwich</i>, roaring,
boiling, and splashing to that Degree that
it was Horror to look upon. And my
Father, after contemplating the Prodigy
along with all the rest, exclaimed, “Well,
Friends! you may say what you will;
but I, though not a superstitious Man,
think Something will come of it.” And
did not Something come of it ... or, at
any Rate, after it? and were not we, that
had previously been sleeping on the still
Waters of a settled Government, horribly
overwhelmed with a Tide of Rebellion,
Anarchy, and Republicanism?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The Year before the Double Tide, there
had been much Talk in my Father’s
Shop, about the Earl of <i>Strafford</i> being
given over to the Black Rod, which I,
being of such tender Years, could not well
make out, but it seemed to carry an ill
Sound with it. After that, he was taken
to his Trial; and passed from his Prison
in the <i>Tower</i> to <i>Westminster</i>, under our
Bridge. We looked forth of our Windows,
and discerned him plainly in one
of the Barges, guarded by Soldiers with
Partizans; and there was much Yelling
and Hooting as he went through the
Arch, which I for my Part was sorry for,
he was so handsome and personable a
Gentleman. The People, however, were
much incensed against him; and, about
three Months after the Double Tide,
there was what I may call a Double Tide
of ’Prentices and tumultuous Citizens, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the Number of about six Thousand, (my
Cousin, <i>Mark Blenkinsop</i>, being among
them,) who assembled themselves in an
intimidating Manner at <i>Westminster</i>, many
of them armed with Swords and Staves,
and demanded Lord <i>Strafford’s</i> Death of
the Peers as they went to the House.</p>

<p class='c013'>I remember my Father, for as small a
Man as he was, collaring <i>Mark</i> when he
came back, and dealing him one or two
Blows, which made me begin to cry, and
run in between them. And <i>Mark</i>, though
a great, tall Lad of his Years, began to
whimper too, which reminds me again of
the <i>Trojan</i> Horse, and the Valour that
may dwell in a little Body, and the
Pusillanimity that may be in a large one.
And, “sure, Uncle,” says <i>Mark</i>, “the
Earl deserves to die, for his” ... Mal-conversation,
or Malministration, I forget
which. And my Father replied, “Never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>trouble your Head with that. Leave
the Powers that be to settle their own
Affairs. Fine Times, indeed, when
Barbers’ ’Prentices must be meddling in
State-politics! To his own Master, the
<i>Earl</i> standeth or falleth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Had all Men been of my Father’s
equable and temperate Mind, we should
not have fallen into the Disorders we presently
did; wherein, no Doubt, there was
much Wrong on both Sides. One Night
we were roused from Sleep by Cries in
the Street that “the <i>King</i> and his Papists
were coming to fire the City and cut
our Throats in our Beds;” but my
Father, after putting his Head forth to
learn the Nature of the Tumult, drew it
in again and closed the Window, allaying
our somewhat ungoverned Fears with that
Composure which it behoves every Master
of a Family to assume when he can, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Seasons of Danger or the Apprehension
of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon there was open War between <i>King</i>
and <i>Parliament</i>, which went on increasing
till the whole Country was filled with
Bloodshed and Confusion, and only ended
in a total Change of Government. We
were now in a State of Fortification; for
the <i>Lords</i> and <i>Commons</i> had directed that
the whole City should be put in a State
of Defence, and that the <i>Lord Mayor</i> and
Citizens should trench, stop, and fortify
all Highways leading thereunto. Wherefore,
all Entrances into <i>London</i> except five,
were stoned and bricked up altogether;
and those five were made as strong as
could be, with Breast-works and Turn-pikes,
Musket-proof. And all Sheds and
Out-buildings outside <i>London Wall</i>, that
were near enough to be advantageous to
an Enemy, were taken down; and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>gave a great deal of Work to do that
behoved to be done quickly; wherefore
even Women and Children helped the
Men in carrying Earth, Stones, &amp;c., for,
by this Time, there was in the City a
pretty general Disaffection towards the
<i>King</i>; and those that wished him well
and could not get to him, found it best to
hold their Peace.</p>

AND now my Memory flies
on to the Time when, I
suppose, I was as happy a
Girl as any on the <i>Bridge</i>.
I know not whether I were
pretty or not,—I rather suppose I was,
but my Father praised me too much, and
my dear Mother never praised me at all,
so that I have no Clue to what was
really thought of me. There’s an old
Saying, “Even a little Beetle is a Beauty
in the Eyes of its Mother,”—I am bold
to think that if I had been a little Black-beetle,
I should still have been a Beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>in the Eyes of my Father. My Mother
used to tell him “all his Geese were
Swans,” which was as much as to say
that hers were not: be that as it may, if
she praised me less, I always felt she loved
me as much as he did; and I loved her
to the full as much as I loved him.</p>

<p class='c013'>I remember coming down Stairs one
<i>Sunday</i> Morning, dressed for Church,—(we
had no Liturgy, nor Church of <i>England</i>
Clergymen then, such was the Will
of <i>Parliament</i>,)—dressed in a primrose
Petticoat and grass-green Mantua neatly
bundled up behind; black Mits without
a Crease in them for Tightness, white
Pinners starched and crimped, and a small
steeple-crowned Hat,—when <i>Mark</i>, meeting
me at the Stair-foot, stepped out of my
Way with a sliding Bow, said, “Bless me,
how pretty we are!” and looked attentively
after me. I felt ashamed and yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>elated; and thought somewhat more of
myself and of him after that; yet I am
not quite sure, now, that his Speech was
not ironical, after all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of my Friend and Schoolfellow, <i>Violet
Armytage</i>, there could not be two Opinions.
She was excessively pretty, and knew it
too well: which was partly the Fault of
her Father, who was always calling her
his “sweet <i>Wi-let</i>;” and yet, even if he
had not, I think she would have found it
out, for all that. <i>My</i> Father called me
his rosy <i>Cherry</i>, but I knew it for his
Manner of Speaking. But <i>Violet</i> always
believed Everything that was said in her
Praise. She was fond of me by Fits and
Starts; and when the affectionate Fit was
on, she would bring her Work and sit
with me in the Arbour at the Top of
our House, by the Hour together. Sometimes
my Father and Mother would join
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>us there in the long Summer Evenings,
and we would sup in the open Air; no
one objecting to it but <i>Dolly</i>, who had
to carry the Things up so many Pair of
Stairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>At other Times, when my Father and
Mother were otherwise engaged, <i>Mark</i>
would come up to us; and sit upon the
Roller or Watering-pot, and say ever so
many funny Things to us both; which
we thought very pleasant. Sometimes
<i>Violet</i> would let her Ball of Thread roll
through the Rails and drop down into the
Street, and send him to fetch it; and
when he had brought it she would do the
same Thing again; which he said was
too bad, but I don’t think he minded it.
I never played him such Tricks myself;
for, what was singular, though we lived
in the same House together, I was shyer
of him than she was.</p>

<div id='i020'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Our first Floor was let to a very learned
and excellent Man, though a very singular
one, the Reverend <i>Nathanael Blower</i>, who
had been Curate of <i>St. Magnus</i> till the
Form of Religion changed. Then he was
hard put to it, where to lay his Head
without fleeing the Country or getting
into Trouble; for the Independents were
mighty intolerant; and he whom we used
to think it a great Honour to get a passing
Word and a Smile from, was now thankful
to take up his Rest among us. Holy
Writ tells us that some have entertained
Angels unawares: if we entertained an
Angel, it was not unawares, though he
was a very eccentric and untidy one. He
said he would have called my Mother
the good <i>Shunammite</i> if it had not been
a Shame to provoke Comparison between
himself and the Prophet <i>Elijah</i>. Indeed
his was somewhat like the “Chamber on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the Wall,” for the Back-room in which
he slept was a Lean-to that stuck against
the main Wall like a Swallow’s Nest, and
hung perilously over the foaming River,
trembling at every half-ebb Tide; but
Use inures us to Everything, and he said
he slept as well in his Nest as a Sailor
in his Hammock. As to his Sitting-chamber,
it was soon a perfect Pig-sty (if
Pigs ever had Books) of Papers, Parchments,
Books, Pamphlets, old Shoes, Hats
and Coats, Medicines, Cordials, Snuff-boxes,
Pipes, Walking-sticks, and Everything
that is untidy. After a Time he
began to think whether he might not, by
a conscientious Conformity, be a Working-bee
rather than a Drone in the Hive; and,
having some Acquaintance with Master
<i>John Howe</i>, the <i>Whitehall</i> Preacher, who
was known to be forward in assisting the
Royalists and Episcopalians in Distress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>if they were but Men of Merit, he went
and took his Advice on the Subject before
he presented himself before the Triers,
that is to say, those who tried the ejected
Ministers whether they might be allowed
to officiate again in Public or not. Along
with him went Doctor <i>Fuller</i>, so well
known by his wise and witty Books; who
was generally upon the merry Pin, for as
pious a Man as he was. He, presenting
himself before Master <i>Howe</i>, said,</p>

<div id='i022'  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>The Back-room in which he slept was a Lean-to that stuck against the Main Wall</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Sir, you may observe I am a pretty
corpulent Man, and I am to go through
a Passage that is very strait. I beg you
would be so kind as to give me a Shove,
and help me through!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Master <i>Howe</i> smiled, and frankly debated
the Subject with him and Master
<i>Blower</i>; and the End of it was, that when
the Triers put it to Master <i>Fuller</i> whether
he had ever had any Experience of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Work of Grace upon his Heart, he made
Answer, that he could appeal to the
Searcher of Hearts, that he made Conscience
of his very Thoughts; and Master
<i>Blower</i> said in other Words what amounted
to the same Thing; howbeit, like <i>Pharaoh’s</i>
Butler and Baker, one was accepted—the
other not.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the Reason was, that they got
upon the Question of particular Faith,
which was very prevalent in <i>Oliver Cromwell’s</i>
Court, and put it to him whether
he did not believe that all who asked for
Anything in Faith would have it granted
them, as well as have an Assurance on the
Spot that it would be so. Which he said,
in that large, unqualified Sense, he did
not, for that he believed many timid
Believers had the Faith of Adherence who
had not the Faith of Assurance; and that
if Prayer were made for some unreasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Thing, however fervently, he did not
think it would be granted. That would
not stand Master <i>Blower</i>; so he had to
come back to his Swallow’s Nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But is it not an extraordinary Thing,
now,” saith he to my Mother, “that
they should, except for the Sake of
catching a Man in his Talk, so hardly
insist on the literal Acceptance of a
Dogma which they themselves must
know they overstrain? For would one
of them dare to pray that his Father or
Mother might come to Life again in
this present World, however much he
might long to see them in the Body?
Or that all Jews, Infidels, and Heretics,
might be converted this very Moment,
however desirable a Thing it might be?
We do the Word of God Dishonour and
make it of none Effect when we interpret
by the Letter instead of the Spirit.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>In this Fashion would the excellent
Master <i>Blower</i> vouchsafe to converse with
my Mother in my Hearing, much to her
Edification and mine. Meantime <i>Violet
Armytage</i> was much more given to Flirting
than Preaching; and had more Admirers
than any Girl on the <i>Bridge</i>; but
the Man whom she and her Mother were
chiefly desirous she should captivate was
no Admirer of hers at all. This was
<i>Hugh Braidfoot</i>, the Glover, who lived
next Door to us; and who talked the
Matter over with my Father very freely
when they had the Shop to themselves;
I sewing in the Parlour behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can see quite plainly through the
old Lady,” quoth he, as he sate on his
favourite Seat, the Counter, with his Feet
easily reaching the Floor, “I can see what
she’s driving at, and don’t respect her
for it a bit. Why should she always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>be buying Gloves three or four Sizes too
small for her broad red Hand, and then
be sending <i>Violet</i> over to change them
again and again till they fit? I’ve a
dozen Pair wasted that she has stretched.
And where is the other Daughter, and
why is she always in the Background?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Kitty</i> is sickly and a little lame,” says
my Father, “and has her Health better
in the Country.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t believe she’s either sickly or
lame,” says <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i>, “only the
Mother wants to get this Daughter off
first—and stands in her own Light by
her Manœuvres, I can tell her. Defend
me from a managing Mother!”</p>

<p class='c013'>About this Time, my Father’s Trade
had a short but surprising Impetus, which,
as he said to my Mother, “was but the
Flaring up of a Candle in the Socket,
just before it goes out.” Cropped Heads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and long Curls being now the Signs of
different Parties, and the Round-heads
having the uppermost, numerous Persons
that had hitherto been vain enough of
their long and graceful Tresses, which
brought no small Gain to the Hairdressers,
were now anxious to be shorn
as close as <i>French</i> Poodles, for Fear of
getting into Scrapes with the reigning
Power. And as, like the Sheep after
Shearing, they left their Fleeces behind
them, which were in many Cases exceeding
valuable, my Father and <i>Mark</i> were
busied from Morning to Night, in washing,
baking, and weaving beautiful Sets of
Hair, which were carefully reserved for
future Occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For you will see,” quoth my Father,
“there will sooner or later be a Reaction;
<i>I</i> may not live to see it, but
you Youngsters will; People will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>tired of Puritanism and Rebellion some
of these Days, and then the old State
of Things will come back; and the
Croppies will be as ashamed of their
Stubble Heads as the Cavaliers are of
their Love-locks now; and, as Hair
won’t grow as fast as green Peas, they
will then be constrained to wear Wigs,
and then will come a rare Time for the
Barbers!” Every Word of which, like
so many other of his Prophesyings and
Presages, in due Season proved strictly
true!</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime, though this Fury for cropping
filled the Till as long as there was
any long Hair to cut off, yet, this being
presently done, a great Stagnation of Business
ensued; for, whereas the curled Locks
had required constant curling, brushing,
and trimming, the round Heads were easily
kept short, and brought only Pence where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the others had brought Shillings. My
Father kept his Hair long to the last;
and, to express his Opinion of the Times
so as e’en they who ran might read, he
set up two waxen Effigies in his Window,
not merely Heads, but half Lengths; the
one representing an exceeding comely
and handsome young Man, (very much
like my Cousin <i>Mark</i>,) with long, fair
Tresses most beautifully crimped, falling
over his <i>Vandyke</i> Collar and black Velvet
Coat: the other, with as red a Nose as
old <i>Noll</i>, close cropped, so as to show
his large Ears sticking out on each Side.
And to make the Satire more pungent,
the Round-head made as though pointing
to the Cavalier, with a small Label superscribed,
“See what I was!”—and the
Cavalier, with a Look of silent Disgust,
was signing at the Round-head and saying,
“See what I shall be!”</p>

<div id='i031'  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
<img src='images/i031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>This Comicality, which had cost my
Father and <i>Mark</i> sundry Hours of evening
Labour,—(I had made the Dresses,) drew
Crowds of People to the Window, so as
even to obstruct the Passage along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Bridge; and excited Peals of ironical
Laughter; till, at length, Mirth proceeding
to Mischief, Blows began to ensue
among those who favoured opposite Sides.
Then the Bridgewardens came with Constables
and Weapons to quell the Disturbance,
and an idle Fellow was set in the
Cage, and another, with long Hair, put in
the Stocks; and one or two of our Panes
of Glass were broken; so that what began
in Sport ended much too seriously; and
my Father, finding he must yield to the
Times, changed the Cavalier’s Placard into
“See what you had better be,” and finally
removed it altogether, saying he was
nauseated with time-serving. But he
persisted in wearing his own long Hair,
come what would; which drew from the
Reverend Master <i>Blower</i> that Similitude
about the <i>Trojan</i> Horse, who, I suppose,
persisted in wearing his Mane and long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Tail after they had become Types of a
Party. And when my Father was called
in question for it by one of the Bridgewardens,
and asked why he persevered in
troubling <i>Israel</i>, he with his usual Spirit
retorted upon him with, “How can a
Tonsor be expected to hold with a Party
that puts Pence into his Till instead
of Shillings?” Whereupon the Bridgewarden
called him a self-interested <i>Demas</i>,
and said no more to him.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> upheld him through
thick and thin, laughing all the while;
though he kept his own bushy Head as
short as a Blacking-brush. Indeed, this
Man, though the Essence of Mirth and
Good-humour, strongly built, and six
Foot high, had not a Quarter of my
Father’s Valour.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for Master <i>Blower</i>, he made a wry
Face on it, saying that Magnasheh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Miksheh (which I afterwards heard was
Hebrew for well-set Hair) was now of no
Account.</p>

<p class='c013'>—One Evening,—I have good Reason
to remember it,—the Days being sultry
and at their longest,—we made a Pleasure-party
to <i>Greenwich</i>, and took Water below
the Bridge. Coming back just as the
Moon was rising, a Boat-full of uproarious
and half-intoxicated young Men fell foul
of us and upset us. I shall never forget
my Sensations as I went into the Water!—The
next Minute, I was half out of it
again, and found <i>Mark’s</i> Arm close round
me, while with the other he struck out,
and presently brought me ashore. My
dear Father also rescued my Mother; and
<i>Hugh Braidfoot’s</i> long Legs helped him
more in wading out like a Heron, I think,
than his Arms in swimming, for he, too,
presently came aland, covered with Mud.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>My Mother and I cried, and felt very
grateful to <i>Mark</i>, who stood panting and
colouring, and looking very much pleased
with himself; and presently we were all
in another Boat on our Way to the Bridge
Stairs, drenched, quiet, and thankful for
our providential Escape.... I, especially,
feeling, oh! how happy!—Yet, in after
Days, there was a Time when I was
ready to wish <i>Mark</i> had left me in the
River—.</p>

THE only Person in the
Boat, who was left for
the Boatman to save,
was Mistress <i>Glossop</i>, the
Widow of a <i>Cheapside</i>
Hairdresser in a much larger Way of
Business than my Father, with whom we
were on very intimate Terms. She was a
Woman of about forty-five, tall, bulky, and
with a very heated Face, which was the
Result of Intemperance, not in drinking,
but eating, as I have often heard her acknowledge.
She was fond of Everything
nice, and had a Habit of saying, “Oh,
I can’t resist this!” “I never can resist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that!” which used to disgust me with
her; and make me ready to say, “More
Shame for you if you cannot.” She and
her Husband had always been well to
do; and now she was Mistress of a large
Business, with Court-patronage, such as it
was, and a Foreman and three ’Prentices
under her; besides keeping a professed
Cook, Housemaid, and Scullion. And
whereas she and Master <i>Glossop</i> had
always been Companions and Gossips of
my Father and Mother, whose Ages were
suitable to them, yet, now she had cast
off her Weeds, she went mighty fine;
and <i>Mark</i>, who thought her sufficiently
unagreeable, though he often went on
Errands to her, said he was sure she was
casting about for a second. To a Woman
of her Habit, the Ducking she got was
unlikely to be of much Good; and as for
her flame-coloured Mantua, and pea-green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Mantle, they were ruined outright: however,
she was very merry about it, and
as we were all engaged to sup with her,
would hear of no excuse. Howbeit, my
Mother was too wet for doing Anything
but going Home and to Bed: my Father
would not leave her; <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> said
he would join us, but did not; and the
End was, that <i>Mark</i> and I, when we had
dressed ourselves afresh and kept our Engagement,
found Nobody to meet us but
some <i>Cheapside</i> Shop-keepers who had not
been on the Water. And though they
made very merry, and though there were
Lobsters, and Pound-cake, and Ducks, and
green Peas, and fried Plum-pudding, and
Gooseberry Pie, and other Delicacies too
numerous to mention, I had no Mind to
eat, but sat shivering, and scorching, and
thinking of the Water closing over me;
and at length, before any one else was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>ready to leave, begged Mistress <i>Glossop</i> to
let me wish her Good-night.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Mark</i>, though he was in high Spirits,
came away with me, and very kindly said
he feared I was the worse for the Accident.
And though he had been very
talkative at the Supper-table, yet as soon
as we got into the open Air we became
as quiet as two Judges, and walked Home
scarcely speaking a Word, till we came
to that last one, “Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I had taken Cold, which, with a good
deal of Fever attending it, made me very
poorly for some Days; and my dear
Mother, who did not show it so much
at first, had in fact taken her Death-chill,
though we knew it not till long afterwards.
Meantime, she kept about; I
seeming at first the worst of the two, and
sitting by the Fire in a Cloke, very chilly,
though ’twas close upon the Dog-days.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><i>Violet Armytage</i> came over the Way to
see me; and saith she, “Dear <i>Cherry</i>,
how well <i>Mark</i> behaved! I shall think
the better of him for it as long as I
live!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I felt I should do so too, but had no
Mind to speak much about it; and, my
Cold being heavy, and making me indisposed
to talk, she soon went away.
Almost daily, however, she came across;
and, when she did not, <i>Mark</i> went at her
Desire to tell her how I was.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so I got well; and just as I was
fit for going out again, my dear Mother’s
Illness became so apparent that I kept
wholly to the House. At first we thought
it troublesome rather than dangerous, and
were not frightened; and, though I sat
by her Bed almost all Day long, she would
sometimes send me down to work below
and keep an Eye to the House. Her Illness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>subdued me a good deal; and <i>Mark</i>
was become unwontedly gentle and silent;
so that, though we scarce saw each other
save at Meals, we said little; and yet I
never felt him to be better Company.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Violet</i> sent me Word that unusual Press
of Business in the Shop kept her from
coming over, but begged I would never
let a Day pass without sending her Word
how my Mother was; which I did, though
thinking, now and then, she might have
just run over, if but for a Minute.</p>

<p class='c013'>One sultry Evening, my Mother being
ready to compose herself to Sleep, bade
me sit below till she rang for me, as she
was sure the Room must be warm and
close. It was so, in fact, and I was feeling
a little faint, therefore was glad to sit at
the open Casement of our Parlour behind
the Shop. The Business of the Day was
done; my Father was gossiping with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> next Door; there was a
pleasing Confusion of distant Sounds from
the City and along the Water; Boatmen
calling “Yo, heave ho,” and singing
Snatches of Boat-songs; the Water trembling
and murmuring among the Arches,
and the Evening Air feeling soft and
reviving.</p>

<div id='i042'  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>While I was thus sitting, all alone save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>for <i>Dolly</i> in the Kitchen, and Master <i>Blower</i>
on the first Story, <i>Mark</i> comes in and
gives me a Posy, saying, “<i>Violet</i> sends you
these Flowers:” and then remained,
with his Hand resting on the Back of
my Chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>I know not how long we thus remained,
quite silent, and I conscious of
great Pleasure in his Presence; till at last,
for want of Anything more important to
say, I observed, “How pleasant the Evening
Air is coming over the Water!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very,” said he, without seeming to
be thinking much about it: and again
we were both quiet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cousin,” said he at length, in a very
gentle Voice,—which was not his usual
Way of addressing me, for in common he
called me <i>Cherry</i>,—</p>

<p class='c013'>—“Dear Cousin, I have something to
say to you”—and stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“What is it, <i>Mark</i>?” said I, softly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have lived long together,” began
he again, faintly laughing, “and I never
felt afraid of speaking to you, before—How
odd it is that I should feel so, now!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What have you to be afraid about?”
said I, looking up at him: on which he
coloured and looked away; and I did the
same, without knowing why.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You have always been my Friend,”
resumed he, taking Courage; “you will
not be angry with me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why should I?” said I. “Is there
Anything to be angry about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps you may think so,” said he,
“when you come to know all. Dear
<i>Cherry</i>, I’m in Love!” And laughed,
and then was silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>I never felt so perplexed what to say
next. “I don’t see that is any Matter of
mine,” said I at length.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“Don’t you, though? But that depends
upon whom I’m in Love with!”
said he, smiling. “If it were with Anybody
a hundred Miles off, that you had
never seen or heard of, you might say it
was no Matter of yours; but, <i>Cherry</i>,
she’s not one Mile off! She’s the
prettiest Girl on the Bridge!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then,” said I, turning scarlet as I
spoke, “it must certainly be <i>Violet Armytage</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is!” cried he rapturously. “What
a Guesser you are!—Dear <i>Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh! what a Bound my Heart gave;
and then seemed to stop! For,—I’m
only speaking to myself; to myself I may
own the Truth—I had not thought he
meant <i>Violet</i>!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah,” said he, after a long Silence,
which I was as unable as he was disinclined
to break, “I dare say you’ve seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>it all along—I may have told you no
News—you are such a good Secret-keeper,
<i>Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I could not yet say a Word—He had
taken my Hand and wrung it; and I
gently pressed his in Sign of Sympathy;
it was all I could do, but it was quite
enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How kind you are!” said he. “What
do you think my Uncle will say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you think her Father will
say?” said I faintly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are not going to tell him just yet,”
returned he, “nor yet her Mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That sounds bad, <i>Mark</i>——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nay, <i>Cherry</i>, you know how crazy
the old Lady is to have <i>Braidfoot</i> for
her Son-in-law; she’ll find in Time he
won’t come forward, and <i>Violet</i> will take
care he shall not, for she will give him
no Encouragement; but, till her Mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>finds it won’t do, there’s no Use in my
speaking, for you know I have nothing
to marry upon, yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When shall you have?” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>When?</i>” repeated he, looking a little
annoyed. “Why, <i>some of these Days</i>, as the
Saying is. You know I am thorough
Master of my Business now, have served
my time, receive good Wages, and am
very useful to your Father. Who knows
but that, as Time goes on, he’ll take
me for a Partner, and finally retire from
Business?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, <i>Mark</i>, so little comes in now,
that he will have nothing to retire
upon. We can but just go on as we
do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said he, laughing, with a little
Embarrassment, “perhaps Mistress <i>Glossop</i>
will take me into Partnership. I’m a
Favourite in that Quarter.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“Mistress <i>Glossop</i>! Oh, <i>Mark</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nay, <i>Cherry</i>, don’t you see, if old
Master <i>Armytage</i> takes a Fancy to me,
he may make it worth her while to
do so, for the Sake of his ‘sweet
<i>Wi-let</i>’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, <i>Mark</i>, Master <i>Armytage</i> is himself
in a very small Way of Business—nothing
at all to compare with Mistress
<i>Glossop’s</i>. <i>We</i> love and esteem them
for old Acquaintance sake, but she looks
quite down upon them. There are
so many small Haberdashers on the
Bridge!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the smaller he is, the less
Reason he will have to look down upon
me. I suppose you don’t mean to say,
<i>Cherry</i>, that no young Man thinks of
Marriage unless he is better off than
I am?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far from it, <i>Mark</i>, that I cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>see what Right the <i>Armytages</i> have
to expect a better Match for their
Daughter; and therefore I think it a
Pity there should be any Concealment.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Marry come up!” cries he, “I would
rather draw a Double-tooth for a fiery
Dragon than tell Master <i>Armytage</i> I
was Suitor for his sweet <i>Wi-let</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you will have to tell him
sooner or later,” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not ... not if we wait till he
dies,” said <i>Mark</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Dies!</i> oh, <i>Mark</i>!”——</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s ill, reckoning on dead Men’s
Shoes, I own,” said he, looking rather
ashamed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s unfeeling and indelicate in the
highest Degree,” said I. “Why should
not <i>Violet</i> tell her Father?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, <i>Cherry</i>, she will not; and what’s
more, she has made me solemnly promise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>that <i>I</i> will not, at present; so you
see there’s no more to be said. We
must just go on, hoping and waiting,
as many young Couples have done
before us; knowing that we love one
another—and is not that, for a While
at least, enough?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I faintly said, “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You don’t speak so heartily, though,
as I thought you would,” said he.
“Don’t you sympathize with us, <i>Cherry</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked up at him with a Smile,
though my Lip quivered, and said fervently,
“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right!” said he gladly. “Now
I shall feel that, whether Things go
rough or smooth with me, you take
cordial Part in them. <span class='sc'>God</span> bless you,
<i>Cherry</i>! And if ever I’m in any little
Difficulty with <i>Violet</i>, I shall come to
you for Advice and Help, rely upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>it!—Hark, there is your Mother’s
Bell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I ran off, glad to leave him; and
found my Mother coughing, and in want
of some Water. When she had recovered
herself, and composed herself again to
Sleep, I sat by her Casement, looking
out on the same Scene I had been gazing
on an Hour before; but oh! with what
different Feelings!</p>

<p class='c013'>The Trouble of my Soul taught me
how much I had cared for him, what
Expectations I had nourished of him,
what Disappointment I felt in him. All
was changed, all was shivered: never to
be built up again! And yet no one knew
what Hopes were wrecked within me.—The
World was going on just the same!</p>

<p class='c013'>I thought how kind my Father and
Mother had been to him, and how likely
it was they had hoped he would marry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>me, and how certainly, in that case, my
Father would have shared his Business
with him.</p>

<p class='c013'>I thought how dull and forlorn a Place
the World would now seem to me, but
resolved they should never know it. I
would go on, in all Respects, just the
same.</p>

<p class='c013'>Large Tears were flowing unrestrained
down my Cheeks, when Master <i>Blower’s</i>
Bell, having been once rung already, was
now pulled again with some Impatience;
and as <i>Dolly</i> had stepped out, I answered
it myself, and found he wanted his
Supper, which he took at no particular
Time, but just whenever he was inclined
to lay aside his Reading or Writing. I
might have spread the Table for him
nineteen Times out of twenty, without
his ever looking at me; however, on this
Occasion he happened to have nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>better to do, and observed I was in
trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Child,” said he, “is thy Mother
worse?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Sir, I humbly thank you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then,” says he, “Something else has
happened to grieve thee, for thine
Eyes are red with weeping. What is
it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But I could not tell him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said he, after a Pause, “young
Girls may have their Griefs that they
don’t care to tell about.—Man is born
to Trouble, as the Sparks fly upward.
And sometimes those Griefs we show
least, we feel most. But remember,
my good Girl, (for a good Girl, <i>Cherry</i>,
thou art!) that there is One to whom
we may always carry our Burthens;
One who can ease them, too, either by
giving us Strength to bear them, or by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>removing them altogether.—Go pray,
my Child, go pray!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And I did as he bade me, and found
Balm for a bleeding Heart. He was a
good and wise Man, was Master <i>Blower</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>When my Mother awoke, she said,
“<i>Cherry</i>, I don’t know what has come
over me, but I feel a Peace and a
Quiet past expressing ... I should
not wonder if you have been praying
for me, my Child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I pressed her Hand and said, “Yes,
Mother, I have ... and for myself
too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This Illness of mine may be a Blessing
in Disguise to us both,” said she
after a Pause—“it has taught me your
Value, <i>Cherry</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a funny Story,” resumed she presently,
quietly smiling, “might be written
by a clever Hand about a Person who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>always fancied herself undervalued! ‘<i>The
Undervalued Woman!</i>’—There are a good
many such in the World, I fancy; poor
Things, it seems no Joke to <i>them</i>. People
who have that Impression of themselves
generally take such silly Methods to
prevent their being overlooked! They
had better make themselves of real Importance,
by being useful and thoughtful
for others. They had better take Pattern
by <i>you</i>, <i>Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>How dear, a Mother’s Praise! Especially
when so seldom bestowed!</p>

VIOLET seemed afraid (and
yet why should she be?) to
come near me, after <i>Mark’s</i>
Communication; and, as
my dear Mother could ill
spare me, I kept close House. We now
felt the Blessing of having a discreet and
godly Minister for our Inmate; for Master
<i>Blower</i> read and prayed much with my
Mother, and comforted her greatly by
his Discoursings. I likewise derived Benefit
from the good Seed he scattered, which
fell, as it were, into Ground much softened
by heavy Rain.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I was able and inclined to step
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>across to <i>Violet</i>, I found only Master
<i>Armytage</i> in the Shop; who said to me
with some Shortness, “You will find my
Daughters within,—I wish your Father
would find Something more profitable
for your Cousin to do, than to be
always in our Parlour, a-hindering of
Business.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I knew <i>Mark</i> was not there just then,
at any Rate, having left him at Home;
and, stepping into Master <i>Armytage’s</i>
Back-room, I only found there a pale,
gentle-looking Girl, with large, brown
Eyes, diligently putting Shop-marks to
a Box of new Ribbons. I knew her
for <i>Kitty</i>, though her return Home was
News to me; and, having not much to
say to a Stranger, I asked her how she
liked the <i>Bridge</i>. She said, “Not at all;
I have been used to look upon Trees
and Fields, and miss the Green; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Noises make my Head ache, and my
Mother keeps me so close to my Work,
that I pine for fresh Air.” I said, “Sure
there is enough of it blowing through
that open Window from the River!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you call it fresh?” said she, rather
contemptuously. “I do not, I can tell
you! Instead of being scented with
Cows’ Breath and new-mown Hay, it
comes from Tan-yards and Butchers’
Shops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When <i>Violet</i> came in, she blushed very
red, but we only spoke of indifferent Subjects:
and, strange as it was of two such
close Intimates, we never, from that Time
forward, had any closer Communication.
Perhaps it was her Fault, perhaps it was
mine: or perhaps, no Fault of either, but
a just and becoming Sense of what was
best for two modest Girls in our new
Relation. For, though it needed not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>be supposed that she knew Anything of
what was passing in my Mind, I am
persuaded that she did.</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus the Families fell apart; and
<i>Mark</i> never renewed his Confidences to
me after that first Evening; and, if he had
Moments of keen Pleasure now and then,
I am persuaded he had Hours of Pain he
had never known before. For <i>Violet</i> was
capricious and coquettish, and sometimes
would vex him by being unreasonable and
hard to please: at other Times, by laying
herself out to please others, as Master
<i>Braidfoot</i>, and their Lodger Master <i>Clarke</i>.
And though she gave out to <i>Mark</i> that
this was only for a Feint, to draw off
the Attention of her Father and Mother
from himself, yet sometimes it was certainly
with no other Purpose than to
plague him, and at other Times, I fear,
with no better Purpose than to please
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>herself; and I know it cost him many
a Tear.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor <i>Mark</i>! how my Heart ached for
him, and swelled against her, when I
found him one Evening with his Arms
on the Table, and his Head on his Arms,
and saw, when he looked up, that he had
been crying. He rose, and looked out of
Window, and said, “Has it done raining
yet? I think I have been asleep!”
But I knew he had not.</p>

<p class='c013'>All his Money now went in fine Clothes
for himself, and Presents for her; so that
if he needed a little Purse against his
Marriage Day, he was not going the Way
to fill it.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was great Talk among the young
People, about this Time, of an Excursion
up the River, to eat Buns and drink Whey
at <i>Chelsea</i>. I was invited to join them,
but declined, on account of my Mother:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>but <i>Mark</i> was to go, and could think of
Nothing else. I washed and starched his
Collar and Bands myself, and sewed a new
Lace on his Hat. He wore a plain silver-grey
Cloth Suit, which was sober, but
very becoming, for he never affected strong
Contrasts, like my Father. Knowing he
was fond of a Flower in his Button-hole,
but was pressed for Time to get one, I
gave a little Girl a Penny to run down
to the Market for the best Moss-rose she
could buy, and gave it him myself. He
thanked me most pleasantly for it, and
looked so comely and cheerful, that when
he went forth, I could not help standing
just behind the Window-blind, to look
after him, and to see the gay Party set
out from Master <i>Armytage’s</i>. First, a Boy
was sent forward, with a great Basket full
of Veal-pies and other Dainties; then
came out Master <i>Armytage</i>, with Mistress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><i>Glossop</i>, who had condescended to join the
Party, and wore a peach-blossom Silk,
with pea-green Ribbons. Then Mistress
<i>Armytage</i>, with a little Basket covered up,
no Doubt containing Something very precious;
and <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> by himself,
with his Hands in his Pockets, as if he
expected to be asked to carry it, and did
not mean to offer, walking a little in
Advance of her; then <i>Violet</i>, looking
sweet! between <i>Mark</i> and Master <i>Clarke</i>—(I
know she liked having two better
than one, whatever might be her Value
for either;) and then <i>Kitty</i>, who by Rights
should have had one or other of them,
slowly following with Master and Mistress
<i>Benskin</i>. I observed her to be a very
little lame, but Nothing to speak of.</p>

<div id='i063'  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/i063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>Well! the Day was fine, the Water
looked lovely, there was Nothing to prevent
their having a most charming Party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of Pleasure, unless it were their own
Fault. I thought of them many Times,
as I sat quietly weaving Hair at my
Mother’s Bedside; and fancied them floating
on the River, landing under tall Trees,
rambling among Meadows, sitting on the
Grass, eating and drinking in the Shade,
and scattering in small Parties. I fancied
what I should do and feel if I were <i>Violet</i>,
and how <i>Mark</i> would comport himself,
and what he would say: but, when I
looked on my Mother’s pain-worn Face,
I did not wish to change Places.</p>

<p class='c013'>They did not come Home till very
late; much too late. I had persuaded my
Father to go to Bed, and let me sit up for
<i>Mark</i>, for Fear of disturbing my Mother.
He said <i>Dolly</i> might as well sit up too;
however, she proved heavy to sleep, so I
sent her to Bed.</p>

<div id='i066'  class='figcenter id012'>
<img src='images/i066.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>And looked on the Bridge</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then I sat at my Window, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>over Master <i>Blower’s</i> Sitting-room, and
looked out on the <i>Bridge</i>. The Harvest-moon,
brightly shining, made our Side
of the Way as light as Day, but Master
<i>Armytage’s</i> Side was in deep Shade. I
heard <i>St. Magnus’s</i> Clock, and <i>St. Paul’s</i>,
and <i>St. Mary Overy’s</i>, strike Eleven.
Then I saw some dark Figures coming
along in the Shade, and stop at Master
<i>Armytage’s</i> Door, and knock up the Maid,
who, after long Delay, came sleepily to
the Door with a Candle. Then the others,
who had been talking, but not much, like
People who were very tired after too long
a Day’s Pleasure, said “Good-night;”
and I saw <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> shake Hands
with the Girl on his Arm, and step across
to his own Door in the broad Moonshine.
Master and Mistress <i>Benskin</i> had gone
Home before, and let themselves in with
the House-key. I counted those that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>entered Master <i>Armytage’s</i>, and only made
out his own Family. <i>Mark</i> had doubtless
seen Mistress <i>Glossop</i> to her own Door,
as was right and fitting. For him, then,
I must expect to wait a good While
longer: and I <i>did</i> wait a good While;
till all the Clocks struck Twelve. Just
as they had done striking, I heard and
knew his Step, and opened the Door
without his knocking.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you had a pleasant Day?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked at him as I spoke, and shall
never forget his Face!</p>

<p class='c013'>—“Good-night,” said he shortly;
“we’ll talk it over to-morrow,”—</p>

<p class='c013'>And impatiently took from my Hands
his Candle, which I was trying to light
for him at mine. But it had been snuffed
too short, and would not light as readily
as he wished; which made him curse it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in a low, deep Voice. I had never heard
him swear before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Mark</i>,” said I, looking anxiously at
him, “you are ill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I’m not,” said he abruptly; “Good-night.
Thank you for sitting up for me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not at all tired,” said I, “and
there’s some Supper for you in the
Kitchen. Let us go there, and have a
little Chat over the Pleasures of the
Day—you don’t look sleepy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From white he turned to deep red.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Day has not been so pleasant as
you suppose,” said he huskily; “you
have been better and happier at your
Mother’s Bedside. I wish there were
more such as you in the World. Good-night,
dear, good <i>Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>—And sprang up Stairs without another
Word, taking two Steps at a Time. I
went to Bed, but not to sleep; I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>not get his strange Look and Manner out
of my Head.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next Morning, at Breakfast-time,
<i>Mark</i> did not appear. <i>Dolly</i> said he had
gone out early. My Father was angry,
and sent across the Way for him, knowing
he was but too often at Master <i>Armytage’s</i>.
But <i>Dolly</i> brought back Word they had
seen Nothing of him. Then we concluded
he had gone for an early Walk, as
was often his Custom, and had outstayed
his Time. However, we breakfasted
without him at length, and still he did
not come back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Confound that Boy,” said my patient
Father at last—(thus, the Fault of one
Party provoked the Sin of another,)—“it’s
plaguy tiresome of him to be playing
Truant this Morning, of all Days
in the Year, for I have pressing Business
in <i>Eastcheap</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Leave me in Charge of the Shop,
<i>Father</i>,” said I,—“my Mother’s Cough
is quiet, now she is dozing; and I shall
hear her Bell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I suppose I must,” said he very
reluctantly; “but I shall trounce Master
<i>Mark</i> well for his Conduct when I see
him next, he may rely upon it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So he left me in Charge; and my
loved Mother being in a Kind of lethargic
Slumber, which often lasted many
Hours, I left the Doors open between
us, and sat in the Shop. As Fate would
have it, not a single Customer looked in
the whole Time my Father was away;
which was lucky, though we did not feel
very thankful, in usual, for this Falling-off
in Business. Before he returned, <i>Mark</i> came
in, and beckoned me into the Parlour.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the Matter?” said I, with
a violently beating Heart.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“I’ve done it!” said he breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Done what?” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Married!” said he: and hid his Face
in his Hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear <i>Mark</i>, how imprudent!” I exclaimed
affectionately; “what <i>will</i> the
<i>Armytages</i> say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What will they, <i>indeed</i>!” repeated
he, “<i>Violet</i> especially! She drove me
to it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Violet?</i> <i>Drove</i> you to marry her?”
I cried.—It sounded so strange!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, <i>Cherry</i>! what <i>will</i> you say? It
makes me shudder to tell you!” he
rapidly said; “Nothing but that Girl’s
incorrigible Coquetry could have made
me break with her as I did; and then
Reproaches led to Taunts, and Taunts
to Threatenings, till bad led to worse,
and she twitted me with my Poverty,
and I told her I could be a richer Man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>in twenty-four Hours than her Father,
and look down upon them all, and she
dared me to it, and said a better Man
than me was waiting for her, and so—Temptation
to be revenged on her came
in my Way, and—I’ve married Mistress
<i>Glossop</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, <i>Mark</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>—“Nay, <i>Cherry</i>, don’t give way so,”
said he, beginning to shed Tears himself
when he saw me weeping bitterly,—“Love
is not a Man’s whole Life, and
what I’ve tasted of it hasn’t made me
very happy. I’ve stepped into a famous
Business, and I shall have a quiet Fireside,
and a capital Table, and kind
Looks if not pretty ones, and—a done
Thing can’t be undone: so there’s an
End on’t!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, fancying he heard my Father’s
Step, though ’twas only Master <i>Blower’s</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>he hastily exclaimed, “You must tell
my Uncle—Good-bye, <i>Cherry</i>!” and
hurried out of the House.</p>

<p class='c013'>When he was gone, I sat in a Kind of
Stupor.... <i>Married?</i> and to such a
Wife!—How <i>could</i> he?—how could <i>she</i>?
... and this increased my Amazement,
for he had been beside himself with Anger
and Jealousy, and hardly knew what he
was doing,—but that she, cool, collected,
and at her Time of Life, could have closed
with his Proposals without the Delay of a
single Day!—how disgusting!—Ah, she
was afraid of losing him!</p>

<p class='c013'>—Immersed in these sad Thoughts,
with my Hands clasped on my Lap, I
was unaware of my Father’s Return till
he stood before me. I started.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has <i>Mark</i> returned?” cried he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He came back, and is again gone,”
said I.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“The young Rascal!” exclaimed my
Father very passionately; “what does he
mean by this outrageous Conduct? I’ve
a great Mind to lock the Door against
him when he comes back!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Father</i>, he will never come back!—He
is married! ... married to Mistress
<i>Glossop</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, trying to speak composedly, all
would not do; the Tears rained from my
Eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>My Father remained perfectly mute.
I could understand his Amazement, his
Vexation, by my own; accompanied, as
I knew it must be in his Case, by great
Anger. I expected every Moment to
hear some violent Expression of Indignation:
he had been so unusually displeased
with him already for what was comparatively
a Trifle.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once, I found myself folded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>his Arms. He did not say a Word; but
the longer he held me, the more and more
I felt that his Hopes for me had been
ruined as well as mine, that his Schemes
and Visions of the Future were all dispersed
and overclouded, that he knew
Something of what was passing within
me, and felt Sympathy without having
the Power of expressing it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,—” said he, releasing me at last,—and
I saw that his Eyes were wet,—“Man
proposes, but <span class='sc'>God</span> disposes. We’ve
had an Escape from this young Man.
Ungrateful young Fellow! And blind
to his own Interest, too, for I could
have done better for him, <i>Cherry</i>, than
he knows of. But—he deserves his
Fate. A miserable one it will be!
He’ll never prosper!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, <i>Father!</i> don’t prophesy against
him! We need not wish him ill.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I don’t wish him ill,” returned he,
“but he’ll come to no Good. He has
done for himself in this Marriage. And
so, <i>Cherry</i>, you’ll see!”</p>

OH! how dreary now seemed
the House! Its Light and
its Life were gone. The
unseen Presence of Love
no longer gladdened it,
and the Shadow of Death was slowly
creeping on.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Violet</i> came to pour out her Wretchedness
and her Self-reproaches to me as soon
as she heard what had happened. She
declared she could never be happy again—she
could never cease thinking of him.
I told her it would be very wicked of
her now, to think of him in the Way she
meant, any more. For saying which, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>suppose she was offended at me; for she
did not come near me again for a good
While.</p>

<p class='c013'>I don’t suppose Tears are often shed
over thick Slices of Bride-cake, with Sugar
and Almonds an Inch deep, such as <i>Violet</i>
and I received (tied up with such vulgar
white Satin Knots!) from Mistress <i>Glossop</i>,
now, alas! Mistress <i>Blenkinsop</i>. When I
took it up to my Mother, she turned away
her Head, and said with her gentle Smile,
“You may give my Share to <i>Dolly</i>,—perhaps
she will like it to dream upon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “I don’t believe <i>Dolly</i> will touch
it;” however, there I was mistaken.
She said, “Law, Mistress <i>Cherry</i>, I’m sure
Mistress is very good.... I grudge
the eating of it, too; for ’tis an unseemly
Match, I calls it; but, there,—one don’t
get such Cake as this every Day!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When I repeated this Saying to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Mother, she said, “She belongs to the
<i>Glossop</i> School, <i>Cherry</i>, that <i>never can
forbear</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mistress <i>Blenkinsop</i> would have been
glad, I fancy, to show off her young
Husband on the <i>Bridge</i>; but she received
no Encouragement; and as for <i>Mark</i>, who
had certainly intended to pique <i>Violet</i>, he
was now as wretched as herself, to judge
from his Looks, as reported to us by one
or two who had seen Something of what
was going on. Happy or unhappy, he
never came near us, on Business or Pleasure;
and as my Father dropped the
Connexion, which was more to his Loss
than Mistress <i>Blenkinsop’s</i>, we now saw
Nothing of one another. For I scarce
went out at all; but now and then Mistress
<i>Benskin</i> would let fall how she had
met the <i>Blenkinsops</i> going to such and
such a Place of Public Resort; he looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>ashamed and tired of his Companion; and
she as fine as the Rainbow. For she
would not only see <i>Funamble Turk</i>, and
pay her Shilling to ride round <i>Hyde Park</i>,
but intrude herself among the Quality in
<i>Mulberry Garden</i>, I warrant her!</p>

<p class='c013'>About this Time Master <i>Armytage</i> died.
Thereby his Family sustained great Loss,
not only of a kind Husband and Father,
but of worldly Goods; for the Widow
only got a Third of the Worth of the
Business, and the Son, who was married
and not very friendly with her, choosing
to live on the Premises and carry on the
Concern, she and her Daughters presently
went into an exceeding small House in the
<i>Borough</i>, where they opened a little Shop
that did not answer very well. After a
While, <i>Violet</i>, unused to such scant Living,
was glad to come back as Shopwoman to
her Brother, whose Wife had no Turn for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Business; but it went sore against her to
be Second in the House where she had
hitherto been always treated like First;
and also it was a Grievance to her to
live among a Family of young Children.
These Trials fretted her till they impaired
her Beauty, making her grow peevish and
thin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime, her younger Sister took
Plain-work when she could get it; and
the <i>Benskins</i> and <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> supplied
her with what they could, which she accepted
gratefully; though, in her Father’s
Life-time, it would have quite affronted
Mistress <i>Armytage</i> that her Girls should
set a Stitch for either of them. But
Times were altered now; she was unable
even to keep a Servant; and, one Day,
when I looked in upon her, I noticed so
many little Symptoms of Poverty, that, on
repeating them to my Mother, she made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>me put up a Variety of little Presents for
her, and take them to her with her old
Neighbour’s Love.</p>

<div id='i082'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i082.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>When I reached her House, I found
her on her Knees, scouring the Door-step
with such Zeal and Noise, that I could
not at first make her hear my Voice, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>become sensible of my Presence. When
she did, she did not appear particularly
glad to see me, but pulled her Pail out of
my Way, and said, “Oh!—You’ll find
<i>Kitty</i> within—<i>Kitty! Kitty!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>And just within the Door, sure enough,
was <i>Kitty</i> standing with her Back to me,
before Master <i>Braidfoot</i>, who was seated,
with a fringed Glove in his Hand, and
holding forth to her very earnestly. He
had sent her a Box of Gloves to fringe,
and I suppose she had not trimmed them
to his Mind, for she was hanging her
Head, and looking very uncomfortable.
As soon as he saw me, he brought his
Discourse to a Finish by saying, “Of
which, more anon;” and nodding a
Good-bye to me, stepped over Mistress
<i>Armytage’s</i> Pail, and walked off. Mistress
<i>Armytage</i> now came in, taking off
her Apron in a great Bustle; and seemingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>much more glad to see me than she
had been just before. And she received
my Mother’s Presents in mighty good
Part, especially the Brandy-cherries, which
had been put in quite as an After-thought,
saying they would make a pretty little
Dish for Supper. I thought she and <i>Kitty</i>
had been more in the Way of Bread-and-Cheese
Suppers now, but made no Comment.
Some People would as soon die
as not try to be thought genteel.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I had nearly reached Home, I
saw <i>Mark</i> coming along the Bridge, in a
hesitating, reluctant Sort of Way. When
he saw me, he stepped out more briskly,
and came up, holding out his Hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry</i>,” said he, lowering his Voice,
“my old Lady and I had almost a Tiff
this Morning, because she wanted you
and my Uncle to come and eat some
of the first green Peas of the Season
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>with us, and I told her I did not think
you would. But, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you kindly,” said I, “but my
Mother is so ill, we have no Heart to
go anywhere now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I knew it was so,” said he, looking
relieved; “but you will not think me
unfeeling, I hope, for putting the
Question?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh no, I think it very kind of you,”
said I; “I take it as I know it was meant.
Won’t you come in? We have seen
nothing of you for a long Time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, not just now,” said he;
“good-bye.” And walked off as if he
were in a great Hurry.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I returned to my dear Mother,
she said, “<i>Cherry</i>, I’m sure you will be
amused when I tell you what I have
been dreaming about,—I dreamed you
were married!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>I said, “Dear Mother, if you take to
dreaming, and my Father to presaging,
there’ll be Nothing left to be surprised
about!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, well,” said she, gently smiling,
“but this was a very pretty, pleasant
Dream—You were married to a Person
a good Deal older than yourself, but
very much to your own Mind, notwithstanding,
and were living like a
Lady, with Everything genteel and
comfortable about you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I smiled to cover a Sigh; and kissing
her thin Hand, said, “May you live,
dear Mother, to see it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said she, “I know I shall not do
that—my Time is growing very short
now; but yet I shall leave you in
Peace, <i>Cherry</i>,—I am so certain of your
doing well. I don’t mean because of
this foolish Dream.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“As for doing well,” said I, “<span class='sc'>God’s</span>
Blessing generally rests on the Child
of many Prayers, ... but if by doing
well, you mean marrying well, do you
think that is the only Way I can be
happy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said she, after a Pause, “I do
not. I think there is no other Happiness
equal to it, where the Parties are
well assorted, and are good to the Core;
but much depends upon each other, and
much upon themselves; so much, that
it had often been better for them they
had never met.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And as so few <i>are</i> good to the Core,”
said I, “perhaps the Balance of Happiness
may not lie on the Side you
think.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps not,” said she, “but every one
hopes to be the Exception.—However,”
she added, after another Pause, “these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Things are not of our ordering; and
whatever be the happier Lot, it is certain
we cannot secure it unless it be
appointed us, whether for ourselves or
for those we dearly love. It may be
<span class='sc'>God’s</span> Will that you shall be <i>Cherry
Curling</i> all your Days, in Spite of my
Dream, and in Spite of your being fitted
for Happiness in another State; but
that it is His Purpose to make you
happy <i>in yourself</i>, whatever you are, I
feel as sure of as that I see you now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When I told her what Satisfaction the
Brandy-cherries had given, she smiled
quietly, and said, “The same Woman,
still!—You shall take her some potted
Salmon to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I did so; but did not, this Time, find
the Widow cleaning her Door-step. She
had gone to Market; the Shop was
empty, and I walked through it into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>little Parlour beyond. Here I again came
upon <i>Kitty</i> and <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i>: she was
sitting this Time, and he standing, and,
the Moment she saw me, she snatched
away her Hand from him, which he was
holding, and ran up Stairs. I felt very
awkward, and was retreating without a
Word; but he, turning about upon me
with a Sort of homely, manly Dignity,
a Mixture of Placid and Resolute in
his Manner that I never saw before,
and which became him very well,
held out his Hand to me, and said,
“You see, <i>Cherry</i>, how it is to be.
There’ll soon be a Wedding in this
House. The old Lady has meant there
should be, all along; but what though?
Shall a Man that knows his own Mind
be stayed from it for Fear of playing
into a managing Woman’s Hands? Had
the Widow been less eager, the Thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>might have been sooner brought about;
however, you and I have known her
longer than Yesterday—she’s <i>Kitty’s</i>
Mother; and enough’s said!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I wished him Joy, and said I thought
he and <i>Kitty</i> would be very happy together.
Then, setting down my Mother’s
little Gift on the Table, I turned to go
away. “What’s that?” said he. “Only
a little potted Salmon for Mistress <i>Armytage</i>,”
said I. “I’ll call <i>Kitty</i> down,”
said he; and going to the Stair-foot, he
called “<i>Kitty! Kitty!</i>” but she did not
answer; and giving me a knowing Smile,
he said, “I don’t think she’ll come down
while we are both here.”—“I’m going,”
said I; “but here comes Mistress <i>Armytage</i>
from Market.” “Oh, then, I’m going
too!” cried he, laughing and catching
up his Hat. “I’ve no Mind to break the
News to the Widow, so come your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Ways, <i>Cherry</i>, we’ll walk to the <i>Bridge</i>
together; don’t look behind you.”...
“’Tis Pity o’ my Life,” continued he,
smiling, when we had walked a little Way
together, “that respect her I cannot; for
you see, <i>Cherry</i>, a Man can never respect
a Woman whom he sees trying to draw
him in! He may walk into her Trap
with his Eyes open, and let her save
him some Trouble, but respect her or
trust her, is out of his Power. First,
she wanted to have me for <i>Violet</i>: that
would not do—then, <i>Kitty</i> was kept out
of Sight till she found I would not have
the other; but as soon as she found
I liked the youngest Sister best, poor
<i>Violet</i> was put in the Shade, and <i>Kitty’s</i>
Turn came. ’Tis ill to speak this Way
of one’s Mother-in-Law elect; I hope
she’ll breed no Trouble between us
when she’s Mother-in-Law in earnest;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>I should like to pension the old Gentlewoman
off, but that can’t well be; so
we must let her have the Run of the
House, and try to make her comfortable
as long as she lets us be so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, turning to a more agreeable
Subject, he sang <i>Kitty’s</i> Praises; and,
reaching his own Door, hoped she and
I should be good Neighbours. “Your
Father and you must come to the
Wedding-dinner,” said he; “we may
not have as many good Things as the
<i>Blenkinsops</i> had, but I fancy ’twill be a
cheerfuller Dinner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When I told my Mother the News,
she took it very composedly, but I observed
her Eyelids give one little, involuntary
Movement, that betrayed more
Surprise than she was willing to show.
“Ah, my dear Mother,” thought I,
“another of your little Castles in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Air for me has been thrown down, I
fear. This was, no Doubt, the Hero
of the Dream, who was to make me
so comfortable! What a lucky Thing
that I care not a Rush for him!”
However, we never said a Word to one
another on the Subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the Wedding took place, and my
Father and I were at the Dinner, which
consisted of every Nicety that Money
could procure; for Mistress <i>Armytage</i> said
that <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> should have all his
favourite Dishes, and she took Care to
have her own, whether they corresponded
or not. So there was roast Pig and
pickled Salmon, Calf’s Head and green
Goose, Lobster Salad and Marrow-bones,
and more Sweets than I ever saw out of
a Pastry-cook’s Shop. As some Things
were in Season and others were not, the
latter, though sweet in the Mouth, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>bitter in Digestion; I mean, to Master
<i>Braidfoot</i> when he came to pay the Bills.
And then Mistress <i>Armytage</i>, ashamed of
having exceeded becoming Limits, went
about to several of the Tradesmen, who
were <i>Hugh Braidfoot’s</i> personal Friends,
and who already were displeased enough
at not having been invited to the Feast;
and she incensed them the more by trying
to get them to lower their Bills, which
they thought and called excessive mean.
Thereby, Mistress <i>Armytage</i> got into bad
Odour, and <i>Kitty</i> came in for her Share,
and shed her first Tears after Marriage
upon it, which I wish had been her last.
However, Master <i>Braidfoot</i> laughed the
Matter off, in a jovial, careless Sort of a
Way; and went round himself and paid
every one in full, and made Friends with
them with a few merry Sayings; so Peace
was restored, that Time.</p>

WHEN I see what a little
Way the Solemnisation of
Matrimony in the Common
Prayer Book lies from the
Burial-service for the Dead,
(only separated by the Order for the Visitation
of the Sick,) it makes me think
how sometimes in actual Life Marriages
and Funerals seem to tread upon the Heels
of one another. Scarce were the Bills for
Master <i>Braidfoot’s</i> Wedding-dinner paid,
when my dear Mother, who had been fast
but gently sinking, departed this Life
without a Sigh. I had left her much
as usual the Night before; but in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Morning was aware of a grey Shadow
over her Face, unlike Anything I had yet
seen, and impossible to describe, that made
me sensible of the Presence of Death.
My Father supported her in his Arms,
Master <i>Blower</i> prayed aloud beside her, I
bathed her Face with Vinegar, and <i>Dolly</i>
ran for the Doctor; but just as he crossed
our Threshold, she gently breathed her
last.</p>

<p class='c013'>How empty the House seemed! For,
though a Person may take no active Part
in its Business, yet a Sense of their <i>Nearness</i>
is accompanied by a constant Feeling
of Companionship, such as I think we
might feel with regard to our <span class='sc'>Heavenly
Father</span> if we would look into the Fact
of His being constantly about us a little
more narrowly. Excellent Master <i>Blower</i>
was a Tower of Strength to us under this
Bereavement; knowing how to comfort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>a Man better than I could, and possessed
of more Calmness and Composedness than
I could be expected to have, though he
said his Heart bled for us all the while.
But he set before us the Blessedness of
my Mother in her glorified State so
strongly, that it was impossible not to
feel that our Loss was her Gain.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the House was yet darkened, I
heard a hushed Voice that had become
strange to my Ears of late, saying to my
Father in the next Room, “I am sure,
Uncle, if you would look upon it as a
Mark of Respect.” ... And my Father,
in Tears, made Answer to him, “I
should, <i>Mark</i>, I should! I shall be
glad for you to accompany us to the
Grave; for, indeed, my Boy, she was
very kindly affectioned towards you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then cried again; and, I think,
<i>Mark</i> cried too. It was Balm to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Heart to think he was going to the
Funeral. An ill-advised Deed had in the
first Instance banished him from us, and,
in Time, he had not only become reconciled
to his Banishment, but, from what
I made out of the Report of others, had
learnt to rejoice in it. The first Signal
of a better Frame was his <i>returning</i> to us,
which cost him an Effort, and then <i>repaid
itself</i>. Master <i>Blower</i> called it <i>Metanoia</i>,
whatever that meant.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Violet</i> was very kind to me. All her
old Affection for me now returned; and
she would bring her Work and sit with
me for Hours. Also the <i>Benskins</i> and
<i>Braidfoots</i> were kind in their Way, though
after a homely Fashion. But one that
better understood comforting was nearer
at Hand. One Evening, I heard Master
<i>Blower</i>, as he met my Father on the
Stairs, say, “Why, old Friend, we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>lived many a Year under the same Roof,
and have never broken Bread together
yet! Bring <i>Cherry</i> with you, and sup
with me to-night!”</p>

<p class='c013'>My disconsolate Father, being taken
by Surprise, had no Power to refuse the
Honour; <i>Dolly</i> was sent for a Crab, and
we spent a very peaceful and pleasant
Evening together, not ended without
Prayer. As we left, the kind Man said,
“Well, Friend, since you won’t ask me,
I’ll ask myself to sup to-morrow Night
with <i>you</i>.” And so he did; and many
a rich and learned Man might have envied
us the discreet and pleasant Guest
that honoured our poor Table. From
that Time, we thus spent two Evenings
together every Week.</p>

<p class='c013'>By this Time my Friend <i>Kitty</i> had
taken upon her all the Importance of a
well-to-do Tradesman’s Wife, which fitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>her as well as one of her Husband’s best
Pair of Gloves. Instead of Stuff and
Dimity, flowered Chintz and even Silk
was now the Wear! looped well up, too,
to shew the grass-green quilted Petticoat
and clocked Stockings. Nothing, Master
<i>Braidfoot</i> thought, was too good for her.
And instead of its being “good Husband,”
“honoured Master <i>Braidfoot</i>,” so
bashfully spoken, as at first, now it was
“dear <i>Hugh</i>,” “sweet <i>Hugh</i>,” or “<i>Hugh</i>”
by itself alone. And happy, without a
Cloud, would the Lives of this worthy
Couple have been but for the Hinderances
of Mistress <i>Armytage</i>. Now it was her
Parsimony in Something her Son-in-Law
could well afford and desired to have;
now her Expensiveness in Something for
which she dared not give him the Bill;
and then he would find it out, and rate
her, half in Sport, and then she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>take Offence in right Earnest. Then
<i>Kitty</i> would cry, and then her Mother
would say she knew she was only in the
Way, and would go off for a While to
her old Quarters. When she got there,
her Tongue lay not still, like a good
House-dog in its Kennel, but must needs
yap, yap, like a little Terrier, that flies
at every Comer; and, to every Neighbour
along the <i>Borough</i> it was, “Oh, you
know not what a <i>Turk</i>...!”—“My
poor, poor Daughter!”—“Temper of
an Angel!”—“Will wear her out at
last!”—“Never know a Man before
he’s married!”—“Peace and Poverty
for my Money” ... and such-like.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, <i>Hugh</i> and <i>Kitty</i> were as
merry as Crickets in their own Chimney-corner,
little guessing or caring what an
ill Report of their Fireside was spreading
all along <i>Southwark</i>: and if <i>Hugh</i> met e’er
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>a Neighbour’s Wife that gave him a dark
Look, as much as to say, “Ah! for all
your blythe Face, I know what I
know!” all he did was to cry, “Neighbour,
how do you do?” in a jovial
Voice that rang along the Street. Thus
the Husband and Wife would go on,
mighty comfortable by themselves, till
some favourite Dish, perhaps, of Mistress
<i>Armytage’s</i> would be set on Table, and
<i>Kitty</i>, with a Tear in her Eye, would say,
“Poor, dear Mother is so fond of a roast
Pig.” “Set it down before the Fire
again, then,” says <i>Hugh</i>, “while I run
and fetch the old Gentlewoman....
I’ll be back in five Minutes.”—And,
in about a Quarter of an Hour, sure
enough, he would return with the Widow
on his Arm, and there would be a little
kissing and crying, and then all would
sit down in high Good-humour with one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>another, and Things would go on quietly
till <i>Hugh</i> and his Mother-in-Law quarrelled
again.</p>

<p class='c013'>About this Time, dear, good Master
<i>Blower</i>, who had hitherto led a removed
Life among us, hidden and yet known,
ministering and being ministered unto
by many of his old Flock on the Sly, did
by some Indiscretion or Misadventure
provoke the Notice of the Powers then
riding paramount, and, coming Home to
us in great Perturbation one Day, told us
he must at once take Ship to <i>Holland</i> in
a Vessel going down the River the next
Morning. This was greatly to the Sorrow
of my Father and myself; and some
Tears of mine fell on his little Packet of
clean Linen as I made it up for him;
and I thought it no Wrong to slip into
the easy Slippers I knew he would not
fail to take out at the Journey’s End, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>little Purse with seven Gold <i>Caroluses</i> in
it, that I had long been hoarding for some
good Use. The Wind was light, but yet
fair: there was a Remedy against Sea-sickness
in my Father’s Shop-window
that I had not much Faith in, it had lain
so long in the Sun, even supposing there
ever were any Virtue in it; however, I
thought there could be no Harm in just
sewing it in the Lining of his Coat,
according to the Directions printed ...
at least, so I thought at the Time, but
afterwards I observed I had made a
Mistake, but it did no Harm, if no Good.
And Father gave him a Bottle of <i>Cognac</i>
Brandy, which really <i>had</i> some Virtue in
it, so we did for him what we could, one
Way or another. And he packed up
what few Papers he could carry, and
burned others, and locked up the rest,
leaving them and his Books in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Charge, with his Blessing. And so the
good Man went.</p>

<div id='i105'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>Often afterwards, when I was setting
his Rooms in Order, and dusting his
Books, I would stand, with my Duster in
my Hand, looking at the Table at which
he used to write, and the old Arm-chair
in which he used to sit, and fall into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Kind of Muse, till I almost seemed to see
his large, quiet, brown Eyes, that were
set so far under the Shadow of his Brows,
and seemed lighted up, somehow, from
within, looking up at me, and his pleasant
Face smiling at me, (he had a very sweet
Smile, had Master <i>Blower</i>,) and his pleasant
Voice saying, “Well, <i>Cherry</i>, is it
Eating-time again, already?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now and then I would open one or
other of his Books, and, if I chanced upon
Anything I understood and that interested
me, would stand reading on and on, till I
was startled by hearing my Father call
for me. At length, he knew where to
look for me; and took to laughing at me
for taking such a Turn for Study; but
one Day he fell to reading one of Master
<i>Blower’s</i> Books himself, and liked it so
well, that, we being but quiet Companions
for one another, now there was so little to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>say, we spent many an Hour, sitting over-against
each other, each with our Book.</p>

<p class='c013'>One Day, as I sat sewing in the Parlour,
and my Father was cutting a Man’s
Hair, I heard his Customer say, “My
<i>Lord Protector’s</i> very ill, and like to
die.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t believe it,” said my Father;
“<i>he’ll</i> never die in his Bed.” Which,
for once, was a Presage that did not
come true.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, he seems to think so too,” said
the other; “at all Events he’s having
Thanks put up for his Recovery, while
yet he’s as bad as can be; which looks
premature.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the Faith of <i>Assurance</i>, I call
it,” said my Father dryly. “Well,
now, what may be the Matter with
his Grace?—a Pain in his Heart, or
his Head, or what?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“A tertian Fever, they say,” returned
his Companion; “you know his favourite
Daughter died scarce a Month back,
and, in her last Moments, she told him
many a Thing that no one had had
Courage to tell him before, and expostulated
with him on his Ways, and
charged him with slaying the <span class='sc'>Lord’s</span>
Anointed; which, ’tis thought, he took
so much to Heart as that his troubled
Mind invited if it did not occasion
this Illness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said my Father, “I’d rather
be the dead King than the dying Protector.
What has become now of all
his Trust in the <span class='sc'>Lord</span>, and inward
Assurance? Does the Grandeur he has
earned with so much Guilt, smooth his
sick Pillow? Is the death he so boldly
confronted on the Battlefield quite so
easy to face, now he lies quiet and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>watchful all Night, with his Silk Curtains
drawn about him? Does he feel
as secure of being one of the Elect,
unable to fall into final Reprobation,
as when he was fighting his Way up
to a dead Man’s Chair? Ah, Sir, we
may ask one another these Questions,
but our own Hearts must give their
only Answer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In Fact, <i>Oliver Cromwell</i> presently
breathed his last, amidst a Tempest of
Wind and Rain, that seemed a Type of
his own tempestuous Character. And in
his Place was set up one that did not fill
it: his quiet and peaceable Son, <i>Richard</i>,
who had gone on his Knees to his Father
to pray that the <i>King’s</i> Head might not
be cut off. He was gentle, generous,
and humane; but those were no Recommendations
in the Eyes of the Army or
Parliament, so he was presently set aside.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Whereon ensued such Squabblings and
Heart-burnings, I was glad I was not
a Man.</p>

<p class='c013'>One Day, <i>Mark</i> came in, all flushed
and eager, looking like his old self; and
“Uncle!” says he, “there’s a brave Time
coming again for Hairdressers! It’s my
Fancy, Wigs will presently be in, (for
Cavalier Curls won’t grow in a Night!)
and then you’ll have a Market for
that Lot of Hair that you and I put
so carefully aside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How so, <i>Mark</i>?” says my Father.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” says <i>Mark</i>, “<i>honest George
Monk</i>, as the Soldiers call him, is
marching up to <i>London</i>, and you have
always said he was a Royalist in his
Heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven defend us from Siege and
civil War,” says Father; “we’ve had
too much of them already. Better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>one Master than many, even such a
Master as old <i>Noll</i>; and if General
<i>Monk</i> is coming up to seat himself in
his Place, ’twill be better for us than
these City Tumults, wherein a Parcel of
young ’Prentices that deserve a good
Threshing, get together and clamour
for Things they know not, till grown
Men are forced to put them down with
a strong Hand. <i>Where there’s Order,
there’s Liberty</i>; and Nowhere else.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Mark’s</i> News proved true; the disaffected
Regiments were sent out of
<i>London</i>, and General <i>Monk</i> with his Army
entered <i>Westminster</i>. He was a right-judging
as well as right-meaning Man,
on the whole, to my Mind, prudent and
moderate, though he sided first with one
Party, then with the other, then back to
the first again. One of the evil Consequences
of our evil Times was, so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>conscientious Men were set down for
obstinate and pig-headed, or else Turn-coats.
My Father, to represent the
Humour of the Time, had removed the
obnoxious Cavalier and Puritan from his
Window, and set up in their stead a
Head that united half of both, which,
revolving slowly when he pulled a String,
shewed now one Side, now the other,
and, as he observed, never looked so bad
as when you saw a little of both. But
as soon as <i>Monk</i>, throwing off his late
Shew of Moderation, marched into the
City, removed the Posts and Chains across
the Streets, seized on obnoxious Persons,
and broke down our Gates and Portcullises,
my Father became sure that a
great Change was at Hand, and the <i>King</i>
would enjoy his own again. Whereon,
he commenced beautifying and renewing
the waxen Cavalier, which had got a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>little fly-spitten, and privately smuggled
into the House a most beautiful female
Counterpart for it, extremely like <i>Queen
Henrietta Maria</i>, whom I immediately set
about dressing in the favourite Style of her
Majesty, that is to say, in a rich velvet
Boddice, with a falling Collar of Cutwork,
Vandyked at the Edge, relieved by
a blue Breast-knot. My Father dressed
her Hair in long, drooping, dark Curls,
with a few pearl Pins; and, abiding the
right Time with Calmness and Confidence,
shut up the comely Pair in a dark
Closet till the happy Moment for their
bursting upon the World should arrive.</p>

AND now the glorious Restoration
at length arrived, and
’tis incredible what a Spur
it was to Trade, and how
the Mercers and Drapers
could hardly supply their Customers fast
enough with expensive Goods; and how
the Tailors and Sempstresses worked all
Night, and Hairdressers sold their Ellwigs,
and Hatters their Hats, and Horse-dealers
their Horses good and bad. For
every one was for pouring out of <i>London</i>,
across our Bridge, at least as far as <i>Blackheath</i>.
Oh! what a busy, what a joyous
Sight it was! All the Streets from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span><i>Bridge</i> to <i>Whitehall</i> were hung with
Tapestry, and the Windows filled with
Ladies. The <i>Lord Mayor’s</i> Cooks set up
a gay Tent in <i>St. George’s</i> Fields, to prepare
a Refection for his Majesty. The
Livery Companies in their various rich
Dresses of Crimson, Violet, Purple, and
Scarlet, lined the Streets on one Side, and
the Trained Bands on the other: Bursts
of gay Music were intermingled with
Cheers and Laughter; Everybody seemed
in tip-top Spirits that the <i>King</i> was
coming. We let our Windows for a
good Premium to some of the Grandees;
but had a good View ourselves of what
was going on, from the Leads—now
there would come along a Troop of two
or three Hundred or more, in Cloth of
Silver Doublets; then four or five Times
as many in Velvet Coats, with Attendants
in Purple; then another Party in Buff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Coats with Cloth of Silver Sleeves and
green Scarfs, others in pale Blue and
Silver, others in Scarlet: by and by, six
Hundred of the Livery on Horseback, in
black Velvet with Gold Chains, then the
Trumpeters, Waits, City Officers, Sheriffs,
and <i>Lord Mayor</i> ... in short, there was
no End to the Splendour and Glory of
that Day; for we had hardly rested ourselves
after seeing them all go forth, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>they began to come back, with the <i>King</i>
in the midst. Oh! what Shouts! what
Cheers! what Bursts of Music! And
he, bowing this Side and that, so smiling
and gracious! “It seemed,” he said, “as
if it must have been his own Fault
he came not sooner back, Everyone
appeared so glad to see him!”</p>

<div id='i116'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i116.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>But the Ladies’ Dresses!—Oh, how
grieved I was!—Sure, they were resolved
to make up for the Dulness and Decorum
they had been restricted to during the
Protectorate; for, indeed, they seemed to
think Decorum and Dulness went together,
and should now be thrown overboard
in Company. The <i>Henrietta Maria</i>
Dress I had so complacently made up for
our Wax Doll, was now twenty Years
behind the Fashion! fit only to laugh
at!—and what had taken its Place, I
thought fit only to blush at.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>For a Moment, when the Party that
had hired our first-floor Window had
thrown off their Clokes, I felt a dreadful
Presentiment that their Characters could
not be over-good; or else, thought I,
they never could dress in such a Manner.
Only, knowing who they were, I thought
again, <i>that</i> can never be—dear Heart!
what can they be thinking of? we shall
have Stones and Mud thrown up at the
Window. “Sure, Madam,” said I to
the youngest and prettiest, “you will
catch Cold at the open Window ...
the Wind blows in very fresh from the
River—will you just have this Scarf a
little over your Shoulders?” “No,
thank you,” says she, shaking back
quite a Bush of fair Hair, and looking
up at me with her Eyes half shut, as
if she were sleepy already. “Forsooth,”
thought I, “those Curls are equal to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Fur Tippet”—And, looking across at
our Neighbours’ Windows, I saw we
need not fear pelting, for that all the
other Ladies were dressed just the same.
Then thought I, Oh, this is the <i>Restoration</i>,
is it? If you, fair Ladies, provoke
ill Thoughts of you, you must not feel
aggrieved if People think not of you
very well.</p>

<p class='c013'>I disliked this Symptom of the Restoration
from the very first—not that it
had, naturally, any Connexion with it.—The
<i>King</i> had lived long abroad, had
become fond of foreign Fashions; but
were the modest Ladies of <i>England</i>, therefore,
to give in to them? Then, what
the upper Classes affect, the lower Classes
soon ape: I knew we should presently
have Mistress <i>Blenkinsop</i> and <i>Violet</i> trying
which could wear the longest Curls and
shortest Petticoats, and look the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>languishing. The only Difference would
be, that the one would become the
Fashion, and the other make it ridiculous.
Perhaps, thought I, I am growing
prudish and old-maidish, I am Eight and
Twenty; but so is <i>Violet</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have often thought, that if the Ladies
of <i>England</i> had at this Time been what
they ought, a good Deal of Folly and Sin
that presently stained this Reign would
never have happened. What! could the
merry Glance and free Word of a light
young Monarch break down Barriers
that were not tottering already? What
had Mothers and Teachers been about?
Where were the Lady <i>Fanshawes</i> and
<i>Lucy Hutchinsons</i>? There must have
been Something wrong in the Bringing-up—I
can never believe all these fair
young Ladies were so good one Day and
so bad the next.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>But the joyfullest Event, to ourselves,
on that glorious Twenty-ninth of <i>May</i>,
was the Restoration to his Country and
Home of our excellent Friend and Lodger,
Master <i>Blower</i>. He seemed to be rejuvenized
by the general Spirit of Hilariousness;
for I protest it seemed as though
ten Years were taken off his Shoulders.
And he talked of being soon replaced
in his Curacy; but, instead of that, his
Friends presently got him a Living in the
City, which took him away from us, as
there was a Parsonage House. But we
went to his Church on <i>Sundays</i>; and, as
he was not one of those who forget old
Friends or humble ones, he would make
my Father and me sup with him about
once a Quarter, and come to us of his
own Accord about as often, and talk
over the Times, which in some Respects,
as far as Sabbath-keeping and general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Morality went, we could not say were
bettered.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now a shocking Sight was to be
seen at the <i>Bridge</i> Gate,—the Heads,
namely, of those Traitors who brought
about the Death of the late King, and
who richly deserved their bad End.
There they have remained for many a
Year, a Terror to all Evil-doers.</p>

<div id='i122'  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i122.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>And now a shocking sight was to be seen at the Bridge Gate</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was in the Spring following the
Restoration, in the Month of <i>March</i>,
that we and the <i>Braidfoots</i> were taking
our Supper together on the Leads, the
Weather being very warm for the Season,
when our Attention was attracted by the
uncommon Appearance of the Clouds,
which, as will often be the Case after
much Rain, were exceeding gorgeous and
grotesque. Master <i>Braidfoot</i> was the first
of us who noticed them, and cried, “See,
see, Neighbours! Cannot you now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>credit how Lovers of the Marvellous
have oft-times set Tales afloat of Armies
seen fighting in the Air? Do not those
two Battalions of Clouds, impelled by
opposite Currents, look like two great
Armies with Spears and Banners, about
to encounter each other? Now they
meet, now they fall together, now one
vanishes away! Now, they both are
gone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And see, dear <i>Hugh</i>,” cries <i>Kitty</i>,
“there’s another that looks like a Cathedral;
and another like an exceeding
big Mountain, with a Rent in its
Side; and out of the Rent comes
Something that looks like a Crocodile,
with its Jaws wide open; no! now
it is liker to a Bull, or rather to a
Lion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very like a Whale!” said a Man, as
if to himself, on the Top of the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>House. It was Master <i>Benskin’s</i> Lodger,
who wrote for the Booksellers.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Kitty</i> started, and lowered her Voice;
for we were not on speaking Terms with
him; however, she squeezed my Arm
and said softly, “It really <i>is</i> becoming
Something like a Whale now, though!”
On which, Master <i>Braidfoot</i> burst into
one of his ringing Laughs, and cried,
“Why, <i>Kitty</i>, you give it as many Faces
as the Moon! What will you fancy
it next?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder what it means,” says she,
very gravely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Means?” said her Husband, still
laughing; “why, it means we shall have
some more wet Weather. So we’ll
put off our Pleasure Party. See what
a red Flame the setting Sun casts all
along the City!”</p>

<p class='c013'>About a Week after this, our Neighbour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Master <i>Benskin</i>, gave my Father a
little Pamphlet of four Leaves, writ by
his Lodger; the Title of which was truly
tremendous. It was this,—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Strange News from the West! being a true and
perfect Account of several Miraculous Sights
seen in the Air westward, on Thursday
last, by divers Persons of Credit, standing on
London Bridge between Seven and Eight of
the Clock. Two great Armies marching forth
of two Clouds, and encountering each other;
but, after a sharp Dispute, they suddenly
vanished. Also, some remarkable Sights that
were seen to issue forth of a Cloud that seemed
like a Mountain, in the Shapes of a Bull, a
Bear, a Lyon, and an Elephant with a Castle
on his Back; and the Manner how they all
vanished.</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” said my Father, turning the
Leaf, “is it dedicated to Mistress <i>Braidfoot</i>?
Here seems to be much Ado
about Nothing, I think.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing or Something,” said Master
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span><i>Benskin</i>, laughing, and jingling his Pockets,
“it has enabled my Lodger to pay up
seven Weeks’ Arrears; so it’s an ill
Wind that blows Nobody any Good.
The Trifle has had a Run, Sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So this is the Way Books are made,
and Stories are vamped up,” said my
Father. “Truly, it makes one serious.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But, a little Time after, a Rumour
was repeated in the Shop that did indeed
make one serious, to wit, that the Plague
was in <i>Holland</i>, and would very likely
come across to us. However, though the
following Year it did indeed rage very
badly in <i>Amsterdam</i> and <i>Rotterdam</i>, yet it
crossed not the Water for another twelve
Months or more; and as we had no such
Things as printed Newspapers in those
Days, such as I have lived to see since,
Reports did not instantly spread over the
whole Nation as they do now.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Howbeit, at the latter End of <i>November</i>,
1664, there really were two Cases of
Plague in <i>Long Acre</i>, which frightened
People a good deal. A third Man afterwards
died of the same Distemper in
the same House, which kept alive our
Uneasiness; but after that, nothing was
heard of it for six Weeks or more, when
it broke out beyond Concealment.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this Time, Master <i>Benskin’s</i> Shop-window
was full of small Books with
awakening Titles, such as “<i>Britain’s</i>
Remembrancer,”—“Come out of her,
my People,”—“Give Ear, ye careless
Daughters,” and such-like, many of
them emanating from the Pen of his
Lodger in the Attick; and with these
and <i>Lilly’s</i> Almanacks, he drove a thriving
Trade.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Violet</i> was sitting with me one Morning,
when <i>Mark</i> suddenly entered, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>seeing her with me, lost his Presence of
Mind directly, and forgot what he had to
say. She on her Part, being just then in
Mourning for one of her Brother’s Children,
for whom I am bold to say she had
scarce shed a Tear, (he being a humoursome
Child, particularly disagreeable to
her,) fetches a deep Sigh, and with a
pretty, pensive Air takes up her Work,
rises, mutely curtsies to him, and retires.
On which he, after a Minute’s Silence,
says sadly, “<i>Violet</i> is as beautiful, I see,
as ever,”—and I was grieved to find
he still thought so much about her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then, my Father enters; and <i>Mark</i>,
of a sudden recollecting his Business, exclaimed,
“Oh, Uncle, here is a capital
Opening for you. ’Tis an ill Wind,
sure enough, that blows nobody any
Good,—I don’t know why you should
not do a good Turn of Business as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>as ourselves by being Agent for the
Sale of these patent Nostrums” ...
and thereon pulled out a Parcel of Bills,
headed “Infallible Preventive-pills against
the Plague.” ... “Never-failing Preservatives
against Infection.” ... “Sovereign
Cordials against the Corruption
of the Air.” ... “The Royal Antidote—” and
so forth.</p>

<p class='c013'>—“No, Boy, no,” said my Father,
putting them by, one after another, as
he looked over them, “Time was when
I should have thought it as innocent to
laugh in my Sleeve at other People’s
Credulity and turn a Penny by their
Delusions as yourself, and many others
that are counted honest Men; but I’m
older and sadder now. To the best of
my Belief, every and all of these Remedies
are Counterfeits, that will not only
rob People of their Money, but peradventure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of their Lives, by inducing
them to trust in what they have bought
instead of going to the Expense of
proper Medicines. A solemn Time is
coming; my own Time may be short;
and whether I be taken or whether I
be left, <span class='sc'>God</span> forbid I should carry a
Lie in my right Hand, or set it in
my Shop-window.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A Customer here summoned him
away; and <i>Mark</i>, instead of departing,
sat down beside me and said, “What
think you, <i>Cherry</i>, of this approaching
Visitation? Are you very much
affrighted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Awe-stricken, rather,” I made Answer;
“I only fear for myself along with
the rest, and I fear most for my Father,
who will be more exposed to it than I
shall; but I feel I can leave the Matter
in <span class='sc'>God’s</span> Hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“I wish I could,” said poor <i>Mark</i>,
sighing. “I own to you, <i>Cherry</i>, I am
horribly dismayed. I have a Presentiment
that I shall not escape. My
<i>Wife</i>,” continued he, with great Bitterness
in his Tone ... he commonly
spoke of her with assumed Recklessness
as “his old Lady” ... “my
Wife has no Sense of the Danger—mocks
at it, defies it; refuses to leave
her House and her Business, come
what may, and tells me with a Scoff
I shall frighten myself to Death,
and that <i>Ralph Denzel</i> shall be her
Third.—Don’t you hate, <i>Cherry</i>, to
hear Husbands and Wives, even in
Sport, making light of each other’s
Deaths?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her Grossness was offensive to me,
and I said in a low Voice, “I do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And if I die, as die I very likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>shall,” pursued he hurriedly, “you may
do me a Kindness, <i>Cherry</i>, by telling
<i>Violet</i> that I never——”</p>

<p class='c013'>This was insupportable to me. “Dear
<i>Mark</i>,” I cried, “why yield to this
Notion of Evil which may be its own
Fulfilment? <span class='sc'>God</span> watches over all.
With proper Precaution, and with his
Blessing, we may escape. No one
knows his Hour: the brittle Cup oft
lasts the longest.—Many a Casualty
may cut us off before the Day of
general Visitation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye,” he replied, with a sickened
Look, “but I had a Dream last Night
... and, just now, as I came through
<i>Bishopgate</i> Churchyard, a Crowd of
People were watching a Ghost among
the Tombs, that was signing to Houses
that should be stricken, and to yet
undug Graves.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“<i>Watching</i> it?” said I. “Did you
see it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I rather think I did,” said
<i>Mark</i>, “but am not quite assured—the
Press was very great. At any rate, I
saw those who evidently <i>did</i> see it. My
Wife has had her Fortune told, and
the Fortune-teller avouched to her she
should escape; so there’s the Ground
of <i>her</i> Comfort. To make doubly sure,
she wears a Charm. For me, I am
neither for Charm nor Fortune-telling,—if
I die, I die, and what then! I’ve
often felt Life scarce worth keeping;
only one don’t know what comes
after!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, with a faint Laugh, he rose to
go away. I said, “<i>Mark! Mark!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” he said, and stopped.
I said, “Don’t go away with that light
Saying in your Mouth——”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>He said, “Oh!” and smiling, opened
the Door. I said, looking full at him,
“Faith in <span class='sc'>God</span> is the best Amulet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is,” he said more gravely; and
went out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently my Father came in to Supper;
and sat down, while it was making ready,
near the Window, looking out on the
River quite calmly. Our large white
Cat sat purring beside him. Stroking
her kindly, he said, “Pussy, you must
keep close, or your Days will be few
... they’ve given Orders, now, to
kill all the Dogs and Cats. I believe,
<i>Cherry</i>, we are as safe here as we should
be in the privatest Retreat in the Kingdom,
for Infection never harbours on
the <i>Bridge</i>, the Current of Air always
blows it away, one Way or the other.
But, my dear, we may be called away
at any Hour, and I never Sleep worse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>of a Night for bearing in Mind I may
not see another Morning. But I rest
all the peacefuller, <i>Cherry</i>, for knowing
you will never be in want, though this
poor Business should dwindle away to
nothing. Master <i>Benskin</i> and <i>Hugh
Braidfoot</i> know all about my little
Hoard, and will manage it well for
you, my Daughter. And now, let’s
see what is under this bright little
Cover. Pettitoes, as sure as <i>London
Bridge</i> is built on Wool-packs!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he ate his frugal Meal cheerfully,
I thinking in my Mind, as I had so often
done before, that the firmest Heart is
oft found in the littlest Body.</p>

AS Spring advanced, the Plague
came on amain. Houses
were shut up, some empty,
some with infected People
in them under Guard, ne’er
to be let out, save in perfect Health or
to be cast into the Dead-cart. Swarms
of People hurried out of Town, some in
Health, some already infected: never was
such a Blockade of Carts, Coaches, and
Horsemen on the <i>Bridge</i>; and I was told,
on the northern and western Roads ’twas
still worse. Every Horse, good and bad,
was in request, at enormous Hire: as
soon as they had done Duty for one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Party, they came back for another, so
that the poor Things had an ill Time o’t.
The Court set the Example of running
away; the Nobility and Gentry followed
it; the Soldiers were all sent to Country
Quarters, the <i>Tower</i> was left under the
Guard of a few Beef-eaters, all the Courts
of Law were closed, and even the middle
and lower Ranks that could not well
afford to leave their Shops and Houses,
thought it a good Matter to escape for
bare Life, and live about the Country in
removed Places, camping in the Fields,
and under Hedges.</p>

<div id='i136'  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/i136.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>Houses were shut up, some empty, some<br />with infected people in them</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Thus the City, which had previously
been so over-filled as to provoke the comparing
of it with <i>Jerusalem</i> before the last
Passover, was in a Manner so depopulated,
that though vast Numbers remained in
its By-streets and Lanes, whole Rows of
Houses stood empty. Those that walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>abroad kept the Middle of the Streets
for Fear of Infection; Grass began to
grow between the Paving-stones; the
Sound of Wheels was scarce heard, for
People were afraid of using the Hackney-coaches;
Beggars, and Street-singers, and
Hawkers, had altogether disappeared; so
that there was nothing to break the
awful Stillness save the Shrieks of dying
Persons in lone Houses, or the Rumbling
of the Dead-cart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, though the Distemper was
raging on both Sides of us and all about
us, it came not on the Bridge. Crowded
Assemblages of Buyers and Sellers at
Markets, &amp;c., being much to be avoided,
we laid in as much Stock as our small
Premises would hold and our small
Family require, of Soap, Candles, Groceries,
Cheese, Bacon, salt Butter, and
such-like. And whereas the Plague
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>raged worse than Anywhere among the
Butchers’ Stalls and low Fishmongers,
we made a Merit of Necessity, and fasted
from both Fish and fresh Meat, as well
for our Health as our Sins, which, if
sundry others had done in a proper
Frame and Temper, ’tis likely they might
have been spared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus we kept close and went Abroad
little, except to Public Prayers; reading
and meditating much at Home, and considering,
as <i>Noah</i> and his Family probably
did in the Ark, that if our Confinement
were irksome, ’twas a cheap Price to pay
for Safety. Of the <i>Blenkinsops</i> we saw
nothing after the regular Outburst of the
Calamity; but we knew that Mistress
<i>Blenkinsop</i> was not only resolved not to
stir, but that she would not so much as
lay in Stores for daily Consumption; perversely
and cruelly persisting in sending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>her Servants into the Danger, she feared
not for herself to purchase Pennyworths
of Things she might have bought wholesale.</p>

<div id='i140'  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i140.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>Keeping the Gates.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Meantime, though our <i>Bridge</i>, by reason
of its being one of the great Thoroughfares
of <i>London</i>, could not well be shut
up, yet the Bridgewardens took all the
Care of us they could, keeping the Gates
with much Jealousy, and burning large
Fires of resinous and strong-smelling Substances.
Early in the Season, there was
one Person who took a mighty Panic at
her own Danger, which was Mistress
<i>Armytage</i>. She had left her Lodgings,
ostensibly to be with <i>Kitty</i> during her
Confinement, but in Reality, as the Event
proved, to be out of the Reach of Infection.
However, the News of each
Day, which she greedily gathered, becoming
dismaller, and the Crowds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>People pouring out of Town exciting her
Desire to be among them, she wearied
<i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> with Entreaties that he
would promise to go into the Country as
soon as <i>Kitty</i> got about again; and, one
Night, a Coffin leaping into her Lap out
of the Fire, her Fears for herself could
no longer be allayed, but she declared she
must go the next Morning, come what
would. I heard much sobbing and loud
talking through the Wall overnight; and
the next Morning at Day-break, saw the
Widow departing with a small Bundle
in her Hand, and a young Lad carrying
her heavy Box. However, the End,
which was impressive, was this. She
over-heated herself in her selfish Flight,
slept in a damp Bed the next Night, and
took a Hurt which ended her Life before
the Year was out, though not by the
Plague.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Soon after, <i>Kitty</i> gave Birth to twin
Daughters, the sweetest little Dears that
ever were seen, whom she very prettily
insisted on naming <i>Violet</i> and <i>Cherry</i>. But
now, the Plague being more and more
talked of, and she being unable to nurse
both, it became a momentous Question
with her whether to bring one up by
Hand or send it to a Foster-nurse in the
Country. At length, the latter was decided
upon; and little <i>Violet</i> was put out
to nurse at <i>Lewisham</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now the Judgment of <span class='sc'>God</span> fell
very heavy on us; insomuch that amid
the general Visitation and Bereavement, it
would have been strange indeed if even
the unafflicted could have been so unfeeling
as to hold back from the general
Mourning. The Cry from every Pulpit
and every Altar was, “Spare, <span class='sc'>O Lord</span>,
spare thy People, whom thou hast redeemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>with thy precious Blood;” and
the Churches were open all Day long
and crowded with Penitents, till it was
found that Contagion was thereby augmented;
whereon all but the bold fell to
exchanging public for private Devotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>About this Time, poor <i>Kitty Braidfoot</i>
fell into much Danger. She was nursing
her little <i>Cherry</i> one Morning, and saying
to me how her Heart yearned for a Sight
of its Twin-sister, when, as if in Answer
to her Wish, in comes the Foster-nurse,
looking defiant and heated, with the
Infant in her Arms, whom without more
Ado she sets upon the Table, and then
retreats to the Door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s your Babby, Mistress,” says
she bluntly, “and you owes me one and
twenty Shillings for the last six Weeks’
nursing, at Three and Sixpence a Week
... it’s taken the Plague, and I can’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>have my own Babby infected, so I declines
the farther Charge of it—’tis a
puny little Thing, and I doesn’t think
would anyhow ha’ lived long.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Puny!” cries <i>Kitty</i>, with Eyes darting
Fire; “why, you’ve starved it for the
Sake of your own Baby! ’Twas as fine
a Child as this, and now a downright
Skeleton!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Woman had an Answer on her
Lips, but Something in <i>Kitty’s</i> Eye and
in her own Heart suddenly abashed her;
and with a “Marry come up!” she hastily
turned about and quitted the House,
without so much as asking again for her
one and twenty Shillings. Poor <i>Kitty</i>
exclaimed, “Oh, you little Starveling!”
and bursting into Tears, put <i>Cherry</i> into
my Arms, and began to unfasten her own
Dress. I said, “Remember, you cannot
nurse both——” She said, “I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>commit the other to you to bring up
by Hand and keep out of the Infection—I
cannot let this little Thing perish,”
and showered on it Kisses and Tears,
quite thoughtless of her own Safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then, <i>Hugh</i> came in, and stood
amazed when he saw <i>Kitty</i> fondling the
famished little Infant. She, thoughtful
of him also before herself, cried, “Don’t
come near me, <i>Hugh</i>! Baby has the
Plague. I’m thankful the Woman
brought it Home; <span class='sc'>God</span> forbid a Child
of mine should endanger a Child of
hers!” And pressed her little one yet
closer to her, and kissed its little, meagre
Hands. Poor <i>Hugh</i> stood aghast at the
News, regarding her from where he first
stood with a Mixture of Wonder, Admiration,
and Fear; at length exclaiming,
“<span class='sc'>God</span> be your Blessing, <i>Kitty</i>!”—he
brushed off a Tear and turned away.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Again saw I that the strongest Heart is
not always in the biggest Body. As for
<i>Kitty</i>, I thought she had never looked so
beautiful as at that Moment. She was
now eagerly seeking for some Token of
the Disease about her Child, but could
find none. “What and if ’twere a false
alarm?” cries she,—“Heaven grant
it!—But now, dear <i>Cherry</i>, take your
little Charge out of Harm’s Reach—and
bid <i>Nell</i> tend dear <i>Hugh</i> all she
can—I’ve Everything I want here, and
they can set down my Meals at the
Door without coming in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked back at her as I closed the
Door, and saw her smiling so over her
Baby that it really seemed as if she felt
she had in it Everything she wanted.
And when I lay down by my little
<i>Cherry</i> at Night, and felt its little Mites
of Hands straying over my Face, I felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>drawn towards it with a Love I had
never experienced for a Child before, and
wondered not how <i>Kitty</i>, who might call
it Part and Parcel of herself, could so
cheerfully risk her own Life for that of
her Child.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next Morning, both our Heads were
thrust simultaneously out of our Bedroom
Windows. “<i>Violet</i> is doing purely,” cries
she; “there’s no Plague-spot—How is
<i>Cherry</i>?” We exchanged Congratulations
and heartfelt Blessings.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short, it proved a false Alarm; but
as <i>Cherry</i> was so miraculously contented
under my Care, her Mother would not
have her back till every Fear of Danger
was over, by which Time the pretty
Creature was well weaned. If <i>Hugh</i> had
loved his Wife before this, he now absolutely
adored her: he said he had learned
the Value of his Treasures too dearly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>run any farther Risk of losing them, come
what might to his Business. So he shut
up Shop, left an old Woman in Charge,
bought a Tent, Horse, and Cart, and
Everything else he wanted or could take;
and, one fair Morning, he mounted <i>Kitty</i>
all smiling under the Tilt, with a Darling
on each Arm, and Bags, Baskets,
and Crockery-ware all about her; and
shouldering his Carter’s Whip, started off
with his Family for <i>Kent</i>, like a blythe,
honest Patriarch.</p>

AH! with that little Gipsey-party
went all the Smiles
I was to see for many a
Day, though I knew it
not.</p>

<p class='c013'>My Father about this Time seemed
dull and sorry of Cheer. I asked him
if aught ailed him in Body or Mind, or
had gone wrong in his Affairs. He said,
no—that he was sensible of a Heaviness
on his Spirits, but could no Ways account
for it. And, with that Stoutness of Heart
which had become a second Nature, he
bustled about and tried to cast it off.
Still I watched him narrowly, but could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>detect no Signs of Disorder. I lay awake
at Night, thinking of him; and amid the
Stillness all about, could faintly hear the
distant Wail of that poor distracted Madman,
who incessantly ran about the Streets
of the City, crying, “Oh! the great and
dreadful <span class='sc'>God</span>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>After Breakfast, my Father said to me,
“<i>Cherry</i>, I shall be absent for an Hour or
two, but you may expect me punctually
at Dinner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Oh, Father! why must you go
forth? is there any pressing Occasion?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, yes, there is,” said he, “for a
Man who owes me Money is going
to make the Plague a Pretext for leaving
the Country, and has succeeded, I
understand, in getting a clean Bill of
Health.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Let it be, if it be no great
Matter.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“Nay,” he said gently, “it <i>is</i> a great
Matter to People in our Condition,
with whom Trade is at a Stand-still.
I have not yet held aloof from any
necessary Affairs, but I give you
my Word I will run no needless
Risks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And so was going forth, when I said,
“There is a little white on your shoulder,”
and brushed it off with my Apron.
When I had done it, he turned about and
kissed me.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were to have Bacon and Eggs that
Day. I had a Presentiment he would be
after his Time, in spite of what he had
said, and told <i>Dolly</i> not to fry them till
he came in. Hour after Hour passed,
long after Dinner-time, and still he came
not. Then I grew troubled, and kept
looking along the <i>Bridge</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>At last, when it was growing dusk, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>put on my Hood and went to the Bridge
Gate. I said to the Gate-keeper, “Did
you see my Father pass the Gate this
Morning, Master <i>Princeps</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mistress <i>Cherry</i>, I did,” returned
he, “more by Token he said he was
going either through or to <i>Lime Street</i>,
I forget which.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “I can’t think why he don’t
come back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” says he, “he’ll be back presently,”
which, though spoken entirely
at random, yet being uttered in a cheerful
Tone, somewhat heartened me, and I returned
Home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Master <i>Benskin</i> was putting up his
Shop Shutters. I said, “I can’t think
what has become of my Father, Master
<i>Benskin</i>.” He said, “Has not he come
Home? Oh, Something unforeseen
must have delayed him. You know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>that might happen to any of us.”
And put the Screw in his last Shutter.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “What should you do if you
were me?” He said, “Well, I’m sure
I can’t tell what I should do—I don’t
see I could do Anything—He’ll come
Home presently, I dare say ... don’t
be uneasy.” And went in. I thought,
“<i>Job’s</i> Comforters are ye all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>About ten o’ the Clock at Night, I
went down to the Bridge Gate again.
They were shutting it up for the Night,
and making up the great Bonfire in the
Middle of the Street. This Time I could
hardly speak for crying; I said, “Master
<i>Princeps</i>, I can’t think <i>why</i> my Father
doesn’t come back! I think Something
must have happened!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nay,” says he, “what can have happened?
Very likely he has been unexpectedly
detained, and thinks he shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>not be back before the Gate is shut, and
is too neighbourly to wish to knock me
up. So he takes a Bed with the Friend
he is with.—Now we’ve got it all clear,
depend upon it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But,” said I, “there’s no Friend he
can be with, that I know of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, in <i>Lime Street</i>!” says he, with
all the Confidence imaginable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Lime Street?</i> Dear Master <i>Princeps</i>,
my Father knows nobody in <i>Lime
Street</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>—“Don’t he though?” says he doubtfully.
“Well, I’m sure I think he said
he was going through or to <i>Lime Street</i>,
I can’t justly remember which.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I turned away in deep Disappointment
and Trouble. As I passed under the deep
Shade of the Houses, some one coming
close up to me, said, “<i>Cherry!</i> pretty
<i>Cherry</i>! is that you?” But it was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>my Father’s Voice, and I passed on in
Disgust. I would not fasten the House-door,
and sat just within it all Night, a
Candle set in the Window. I opened
my Bible at random, in Hope of Something
to hearten and comfort.—The Words
I lighted on were, “I sought him, but
could not find him; I called him, but
he gave me no Answer.” And the
Page was wet with my Tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>As soon as Day broke, I was again at
the Door. People going to Market early
looked at me strangely as they passed. It
struck me my Appearance was not very
tidy, so I went in, washed and re-dressed
myself, which refreshed me a little, drank
a Cup of Milk, and then put on my
Hood and went down to the Gate. I
said, “Master <i>Princeps</i>, I can’t think
what’s come to my Father.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bless my Soul!” cries he, “what,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>has he not been Home all Night?
Then you see, he <i>must</i> be sleeping out,
and will not have risen yet, to disturb
his Friend’s Family. So, go your Ways
back, Mistress <i>Cherry</i>, and don’t be
fretting; rely on it he will return as
soon as he has breakfasted, which he
cannot have done yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I turned away, sad at my Heart;
and as I passed <i>John Armytage’s</i> Shop, I
looked up at <i>Violet’s</i> Window, and saw
her dressed, and just putting back her
white Curtains. She looked down on
me, and nodded, and smiled, but I shook
my Head sorrowfully, and turned my
Face away. Before I reached my own
Door, I felt some one twitching my
Cloak behind, and she comes up to me
all panting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry!</i> dear <i>Cherry</i>!” says she
breathlessly, “what’s the Matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“I’ve lost my Father,” said I, with
filling Eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead!” cries she, looking affrighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He may be,” said I, bursting into
Tears, “for he has not come Home all
Night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, if that’s all,” says she, putting
her Arm round me and drawing me into
the House, “all may yet be well.—How
many Women might cry, <i>Cherry</i>, if they
thought their Husbands and Fathers
were dead, every Time they stayed out
all Night! Come, tell me all about
it——” And she entered with such
Concern into my Grief that its Bitterness
was allayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come,” she said, “let us give him
till Dinner-time—he may drop in any
Minute, you know, and if you go looking
for him, you know not where,
you may miss him. So give him till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Dinner-time, and after that, if he comes
not, go and knock at every Door in
<i>Lime Street</i>, if you will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And she stayed, wiling the slow Time
as long as she could with talking of this
and that. At length, Dinner-time came;
I could scarce await it, and directly the
Clock struck, I started forth. It occurred
to me I would go to <i>Mark</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>As I approached the Gate, I heard
Master <i>Princeps</i> say to the second Gate-keeper,
“I’ll lay you a Wager this Girl
is coming again to ask me why she
can’t find her Father.”</p>

<div id='i158'  class='figcenter id016'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>Cherry seeking her father</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Instead of which, I only said as I came
up to him, “I’m going to look for my
Father, Master <i>Princeps</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” says he, “I wish you may
find him with all my Heart, but it
seems like looking for a Pin in a Hayfield.—Perhaps
he’ll return while you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>are away.... Take Care where you
go; the Streets and Lanes are dangerous——”</p>

<p class='c013'>There were People paying Toll; and
while I was waiting to pass, I heard one
Man ask another if he had seen the great
Plague-pit dug in <i>Aldgate</i>, forty Feet long,
and twenty Feet deep; adding, he believed
many People that were picked up
in the Streets were cast into it before
it was well known if they were dead or
alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>I darted through the Toll-gate the
Moment it was clear, and made for
<i>Cheapside</i>. Oh! how awful the Change,
during a few Weeks! Not a Creature
stirring, where lately all had been alive.—At
the Turn of a Lane I met a Man
wheeling a dead Person in a Hand-barrow,
and turning his own Head aside.
Houses were deserted or silent, marked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>with the fatal red Cross. Within one,
I heard much wailing and sobbing. At
length I reached <i>Mark’s</i> House. ’Twas all
shut up!—and a Watchman sat smoking
on the Door-step. He said, “Young
Woman, what do you want?” I said,
“I want to speak to <i>Mark Blenkinsop</i>.” ...
He said, “Nobody must go out or in—the
House is under Visitation.”—My
Heart sank when I remembered <i>Mark’s</i>
Forebodings of himself, and I said, “Is
he dead?” “I know not whether he
be dead or no,” replied the Watchman;
“a Maid-servant was put into the Cart
the Night before last, and a ’Prentice
the Night before that.—Since then,
they’ve kept mighty quiet, and asked
for Nothing, though I’ve rung the
House-bell two or three Times. But
the Night-watch told me that a Woman
put her Head out of Window during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the Night, and called out, ‘Oh! Death,
Death, Death!’ three several Times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Ring the Bell again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He did so, and pulled it so violently
this Time, that the Wire broke. We
gave each other a blank Look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See!” said I, “there’s a Window open
on the Second Story——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tis where the Woman put out her
Head and screeched, during the Night,”
said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Could not you get a Ladder,” said I,
“and look in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said he, “I will, if you will
stay here and see that no one comes out
while I’m gone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I said I would, but I should have
been a sorry Guard had any one indeed
rushed forth, so weak was I and trembling.
I thought of <i>Mark</i> lying within,
perhaps stiff and cold.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Presently the Watchman returned with
a Ladder, but it was too short, so then
he had to go for another. This Time he
was much longer gone, so that I was
almost beside myself with waiting. All
this Time not a Creature passed. At
length a Man came along the Middle of
the Street, holding a red Rod before him.
He cried, “What do you there?” I
said, “We know not whether the Family
be dead or have deserted the House—a
Watchman has gone for a Ladder to
look through the open Window.” He
said, “I will send some one to look to
it,” and passed on.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the Watchman and another Man
appeared, carrying a long Ladder between
them. They set it against the Window,
and the Watchman went up. When he
had looked in, he cried out in a fearful
Voice, “There’s a Woman in white, lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>all along on the Floor, seemingly dead,
with a Casket of Jewels in her Hand.—Shall
I go in?”—“Aye, do,” I exclaimed.
The other Man, hearing talk
of Jewels, cried, “Here, come you down,
if you be afraid, and I’ll go in,” and
gave the Ladder a little Shake; which,
however, only made the Watchman at
once jump through the Window. Then
up came two Men, saying, “We are from
my <i>Lord Mayor</i>, empowered to seal up
any Property that may be left, if the
Family indeed be dead.”—So they went
up the Ladder too, and the other Man
had no Mind to go now; and presently
the Watchman comes out of the
House-door, looking very pale, and
says he, “Besides the Lady on the
Floor, with all her Jewels about her,
there’s not a Soul, alive nor dead, in
the House; the others must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>escaped over the back Walls and Out-houses.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then my Heart gave a great Beat, for
I concluded <i>Mark</i> had escaped, leaving
his Wife to die alone; and now all my
Thoughts returned to my Father. I
hastened to one or two Acquaintances of
his, who, it was just possible, might have
seen him; but their Houses were one
and all shut up, and, lying some Way
apart from each other, this took up much
Time. I now became bewildered and
almost wild, not knowing where to look
for him; and catching like a drowning
Man at a Straw, I went to <i>Lime Street</i>.
Here I went all up one Side and all
down the other, knocking at every Door
that was not padlocked. At first I made
my Inquiries coherently enough, and
explained my Distress and got a civil
Answer; but, as I went on and still did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>not find him, my Wits seemed to unsettle,
and, when any one came to the
Door, which was often not till after much
knocking and waiting, I had got nothing
to say to them but, “Have you seen my
Father?” and when they stared and
said, “Who is your Father?” I could
not rightly bring his Name to Mind.
This gave me some Sign of Wildness, I
suppose, for after a While, the People
did not so much look strange as pitying,
and said, “Who is your Father, poor
Girl?” and waited patiently for me to
answer. All except one rough Man,
who cried fiercely, “In the Dead-pit in
<i>Aldgate</i>, very likely, where my only
Child will be to-night.” Then I lost
Sense altogether, and shrieked, “Oh!
he’s in the Pit! <i>Father! Father!</i>”
and went running through the Streets,
a-wringing my Hands. At length a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Voice far off answered, “Daughter!
Daughter! here I am!” and I rushed
towards it, crying, “Oh, where? I’m
coming! I’m coming!” And so got
nearer and nearer till it was only just at
the Turn of the next Street; but when
I gained it, I came upon a Party of
disorderly young Men. One of them
cries, “Here I am, Daughter!” and
burst out laughing. But I said, “Oh,
you are not he,” and brake away from
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stay, I know all about him,” cries
another. “Was he tall or short?” Oh,
wicked, wicked Men, thought I, ’tis such
as you that break Fathers’ Hearts!</p>

<div id='i166'  class='figcenter id017'>
<img src='images/i166.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>How I got back to the <i>Bridge</i>, I know
not. I was put to Bed in a raging
Fever. In my Deliration I seemed to
see my Father talking earnestly with
another Man whose Face I knew not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>and who appeared to hear him with Impatience,
and want to leave him, but my
Father laid his Hand upon his Arm.
Then the other, methought, plucked a
heavy Bag from under his Cloke, and cast
it towards my Father, crying, “Plague
take it and you too!” Then methought
my Father took it up and walked off
with it into the Street, but as he went, he
changed Colour, stopped short, staggered,
and fell. Presently I seemed to hear a
Bell, and a dismal Voice crying, “Bring
out your Dead!”—and a Cart came
rumbling along, and a Man held a Lanthorn
to my Father’s Face, and without
more Ado, took him up and cast him
into the Cart. Then methought, a Man
in the Cart turned the Horse about, and
drove away without waiting to call anywhere
else, to a dismal lone Field, lying
all in the Blackness of Darkness, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the Cart turned about, and shot a Heap
of senseless Bodies into a great, yawning
Pit ... them that a few Hours back
had been strong, hearty Men, beautiful
Women, smiling Children.</p>

WHEN I returned to my
Reason, it was with an inexpressible
Sense of Weakness
and Weariness. The
first Thing I saw was dear
<i>Violet’s</i> Face close to mine, her large, dark
Eyes fixed full upon me; and as soon as
she saw that I knew her, she exclaims,
“<i>Cherry</i>, dear <i>Cherry</i>! I thought I had
no more Tears left to shed, but I must
cry again with Pleasure now—” and
wept over me.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Is he come back yet?” She
said, “You must only think of getting
well now.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Ah,” I said, “I know he is not,”
and turned my Head away, and still
felt her warm Tears dropping over me.
They seemed to heal where they fell;
and presently, I shed Tears too, which
cleared my Head, and somewhat relieved
me; but oh! the Weakness!—</p>

<p class='c013'>I was very slow getting well. All the
While, dear <i>Violet</i> kept with me, read to
me, cheered me, cherished me ... oh,
what a Friend! How Trouble brings
out the real Good in People’s Characters,
if there be any!</p>

<p class='c013'>Before I was well able to sit up,
Master <i>Benskin</i> sent in Word he had
Something important to say to me as
soon as I was equal to hearing it. I
thought he might have got some Clue to
my Father, and said I was quite equal to
hearing Anything he had to tell. Then
he came in, treading on Tip-toe, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>looking very awe-stricken; and, says he,
“Mistress <i>Cherry</i>,”—taking a Chair as
he spoke, a good Way off from me,—“the
lamented Event which we may now
consider to have taken place....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Master <i>Benskin</i>, no,” interrupted
I, faintly; “I still hope there has been
<i>no</i> lamented Event——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes it my Duty,” continued he,
without minding me, “to tell you that
you need be under no Uneasiness about
pecuniary Circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am not, I assure you,” said I. “Oh
that I had nothing worse to be uneasy
about!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This House,” continued he, “was
your Father’s for ninety-nine Years,
and is now yours; and he moreover
had saved six hundred Pounds, three
hundred of which he lent me, and
three hundred <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i>, we paying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>him five per Cent., which we will
continue to pay you, or hand over to
you the Principal, whichever you like.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Master <i>Benskin</i>,” said I;
“I should wish Everything to continue
just as it is.... I am sure my Father’s
Money can’t be in better Hands; and
I shall recommence inquiring for him
directly I am strong enough, which I
almost am already.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah,” said he, with a sorrowful Smile
and a Shake of the Head, “how slow
Women are to give up Hope!...
Sure enough, ’tis one of the cardinal
Virtues; but they practise it as if
’twere their Nature, without making
a Merit of it. I wish you well from
my Heart, Miss <i>Cherry</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this While I was fretting to see
Master <i>Blower</i>. I said often to <i>Violet</i>,
“I wish Master <i>Blower</i> would look in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>to see me, and talk to me and pray
with me as he used to do with my
Mother. Sure, I’m sick enow! and
he might, for as long as he has known
me, count me the same as one of his
own Congregation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And <i>Violet</i> would make Answer, “Indeed,
<i>Cherry</i>, if you consider how the
good Man is wearing himself out among
his own Flock, going hither and thither
without setting his Life at a Pin’s Purchase,
spending all his Time in Visitation
that is not taken up with the
Services of the Church, you need not be
surprised he comes not so far as this,
especially as he knows not of your
Affliction nor your Illness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you, that are not a Church-woman,
know he does all you say?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I had it from the old Woman that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>brings the Curds and Whey,” returned
<i>Violet</i>; “she, you know, is one of his
Parishioners; and, from what she says
of him, it appears he could not do more
if he were a Dissenter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A Dissenter, indeed! I admire that!”
said I. “If he were a slothful, timid,
self-indulgent Person, you would bestow
all his Faults on his Church; but because
his Light shines before Men, so
that they cannot help glorifying his
Father which is in Heaven, you say
he could hardly do more if he were a
Dissenter!—I shall go to him as soon
as ever I get well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And so I did; while, indeed, I was
hardly strong enough for so long a Walk;
for I had a Notion he would tell me
where to find my Father; or comfort
me, maybe, if he thought he could not
be found. It was now late in <i>September</i>.—His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Parish was one of the worst in
<i>Whitechapel</i>,—he lived in a roomy, gloomy
old Parsonage-house, too large for a single
Man, in a Street that was now deserted
and grass-grown. The first Thing I saw
was a Watchman asleep on the Steps,
which gave me a Pang; for, having heard
Master <i>Blower</i> was so active in his Parish,
I somehow had never reckoned on his
being among the Sick, though that was
a very just Reason why he should be.
I had thought so good a Man would
lead a charmed Life, forgetful that in
this World there is often one Event to
the Righteous and to the Wicked, and
that if the Good always escaped, no Harm
would have befallen my Father. However,
this sudden Shock, for such it was,
brought Tears into my Eyes, and I began
to be at my Wits’ End, who should tell
me now where to find my Father, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>lament over the Illness of my good and
dear Friend, Master <i>Blower</i>. Then I bethought
me,—Perhaps he is not in the
House, but may have left it in Charge
of some Woman, who is ill,—if I waken
the Watchman, he certainly will not let
me in; the Key is grasped firmly in his
Hand, so firmly that I dare not try to
take it, but yet I must and will get in.—</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I observed that, in carelessly
locking the Door, the Lock had overshot
it, so that, in Fact, the Door, instead of
being locked, would not even shut. So
I stept lightly past the Watchman and
into the House; and the first Thing
within the Threshold was a Can of Milk,
turned quite sour, which shewed how
long it must have stood without any
Body’s being able to fetch it. I closed
the Door softly after me, and went into
all the ground-floor Rooms; they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>empty and close shuttered: the Motes
dancing in the Sunbeams that came
through the round Holes in the Shutters.
Then I went softly up Stairs, and
looked timidly into one or two Chambers,
not knowing what ghastly Sight I might
chance upon; but they were tenantless.
As I stood at pause in the Midst of one
of them, which was a Sitting-room, and
had one or two Chairs out of their Places,
as if it had been never set to rights since
it was last in Occupation, I was startled
by hearing a Man in the Room beyond
giving a loud, prolonged Yawn, as though
he were saying, “Ho, ho, ho, ho, hum!”
Then all was silent again: I thought it
must be Master <i>Blower</i>, and went forward,
but paused, with my Hand on
the Lock. Then I thought I heard a
murmuring Voice within; and, softly
opening the Door and looking in, perceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>a great four-post Bed with dark
green Curtains drawn close all round it,
standing in the Midst of a dark oaken
Floor that had not been bees-waxed recently
enough to be slippery. Two or
three tall, straight-backed Chairs stood
about; a Hat upon one, a Boot upon
another, quite in the Style of Master
<i>Blower</i>; and close to the Bed was a
Table with Jugs, Cups, and Phials, and
a Night-lamp still burning, though ’twas
broad Day. The Shutters also were
partially shut, admitting only one long
Stream of slanting Light over-against the
Bed; but whether any one were in the
Bed, I could not at first make out, for
all was as still as Death. Presently, however,
from within the Curtains came a
somewhat thick Voice, exclaiming, “Oh
<span class='sc'>Lord</span>, my Heart is ready, my Heart is
ready! I will sing and give Praise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>with the best Member that I have!
Awake, Lute and Harp! I myself
will awake right early!”</p>

<div id='i179'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i179.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>Here the dear good Man fell a-coughing,
as if Something stuck in his Throat;
and I tip-toeing up to the Bedside, withdrew
the Curtains and softly said, “Master
<i>Blower</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Never shall I forget my first Sight of
him! There he lay on his Back, with
Everything quite clean and fresh about
him, not routed and tumbled as most
Men’s would have been, but as smooth
as if just mangled:—his Head, without
e’er a Nightcap, lying straight on his
Pillow, his Face the Mirror of Composedness
and Peaceification, and his great,
brown Eyes, glowing with some steady,
not feverish Light, turned slowly round
upon me, as if fresh from beholding
some beatific, solemnifying Sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, <i>Cherry</i>,” says he, looking much
pleased, “are you come to look on me
before I die? I thought I had taken
my last Sight of all below,”—and reaching
out his Hand to me from under the
Bedclothes, I was shocked to perceive
how it was wasted: every Knuckle a
perfect Knob.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Don’t touch me!” cries he, plucking
it away again, and burying it out
of Sight,—“I forgot you hadn’t had the
Plague. What a selfish Fellow I am!—How’s
your dear Father, <i>Cherry</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I could not withhold myself from
weeping, and was unable to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, I see how it is,” says he kindly;
“poor <i>Cherry</i>! poor <i>Cherry</i>! ‘the Righteous
perish and no Man layeth it to
Heart,’—I heard a Voice say, ‘Write:
Blessed are the Dead which die in the
<span class='sc'>Lord</span>. Yea, saith the Spirit, for they
rest from their Labours.’... I shall
see him before you will, <i>Cherry</i>. Go
Home, Child, go Home, ... this
Air is fraught with Danger.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “I am not afraid of it, Sir,—I
would rather stay a While with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then,” said he, “just give me
a Drink of Water, or Anything liquid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>you can find; for I have had Nothing
but what I could help myself to, these
twenty-four Hours. My Throat is so
bad, I cannot swallow Anything solid....
Oh! Oh!—” And as he held
back his Throat to drink, I noticed the
Plague Swellings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That will do nicely, now,” sighed
he, when I had smoothed his Pillow;
“and now go, I prithee, dear <i>Cherry</i>,
and look after poor <i>Dorcas</i>, who, I
fear, must be dead or dying somewhere
about the House.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I did as he bade me; and, as I
knew she was not on the Floor below,
I went in quest of her up Stairs. <i>Dorcas</i>
had lived with Master <i>Blower</i> ever since
he commenced Housekeeping; and had
had the Help of a younger Maid, who
now, it seemed, had left, or died. She
was a Widow-woman in her third score,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>eccentric, like her Master, in some
Matters; but withal, of the sweetest,
pleasantest Countenance! and of pleasant
Conditions too, so that they were well
matched. She preferred being called
Mistress <i>Peach</i>; but Master <i>Blower</i> liked
calling her <i>Dorcas</i>, and carried his Point.</p>

<p class='c013'>I found her in the upper Story, lying
all across her Bed, dressed, but more dead
than alive. “Alas! young Woman,”
says she.... “What! is it Mistress
<i>Cherry</i>? Heaven be praised! How
is my Master? Doth he live yet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, Yes, and I hoped was going
on well.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah,” says she, “I left him at Death’s
Door, but could no longer keep about
myself; so, set him straight as well
as I could, and then crawled up here,
thinking to bundle my Mattress down
Stairs, and at all events die within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>hearing of him. But ’twas quite beyond
my Strength.... I fell all along,
and here I’ve been ever since.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she began to groan terribly, but
I made her as comfortable as I could,
dressed her Throat, persuaded her to
swallow a little cooling Drink, and
loosened her Clothes; all which she
took very thankfully, but then became
restless about her Master, and prayed
me to go down to him, for he wanted
me more than she did.</p>

<p class='c013'>So I returned to Master <i>Blower</i>, whom
I now found a good deal more suffering
and feverish than when I left him, and
beginning to toss about. I quite gave
up all Intention of leaving the House,
yet thought <i>Violet</i> might be uneasy about
me; therefore I stepped down to beg
the Watchman to send a Message to
her; but found the House-door locked.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>On my rapping against it and calling,
he unlocked it and looked in. “Hallo,
young Woman,” says he, “how came
you here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I stepped in while you were asleep,”
said I, “the Door being ajar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Asleep? that’s a pretty Tale to tell
of me,” quoth he. “I wonder if <i>you</i>
wouldn’t feel sleepy sometimes, sitting
from Morn to Night on a Door-step,
full in the Sun!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want to tell no Tales,” said I,
“but only desire to send Word to my
Friends on the <i>Bridge</i> that I cannot
return to them at present, being wanted
here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Return? of course you cannot,” says
he. “Why, do you suppose Persons are to
be allowed to walk in and out of Houses
under Visitation at their Will? ’Tis
clear against my <i>Lord Mayor’s</i> Orders.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>This had escaped me; however, it
made no Difference; and he engaged to
let <i>Violet</i> know the Cause of my Detention.
Then I returned to my Charges,
and, to my great Surprise, found <i>Dorcas</i>
had crawled nearly all down the Flight
of Stairs between her and Master <i>Blower</i>,
and was now lying all along. She said,
“I thought I must see how Master was
... if you will but tumble the Mattress
down, Mistress <i>Cherry</i>, I’ll lie just
within his Door,—then you won’t have
to run up and down Stairs so often.”
It did, indeed, make it easier for me to
attend to them both; and truly I never
had such a Night before nor since; for
though my dear Mother’s Sufferings had
been long drawn out and very sad to
witness, they had never amounted to
acute Agony. The Fever of both ran
very high all Night, and it seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>me that Master <i>Blower</i> in his Deliration
went through the whole Book of <i>Job</i> in
his Head, from the disjointed Fragments
he uttered here and there. Also he
seemed much argufying with an impenitent
Sinner in his Flock, his Reasonings
and tender Persuasives with whom
were enough to have melted a Stone.
As to Mistress <i>Peach</i>, I must say her
Thoughts ran mostly on her Jams, ...
she conceited herself opening Pot after
Pot and finding every one fermented;
and kept exclaiming in a doleful Voice,
“Oh dear, here’s another Bishop’s Wig!”
So that, what with being ready to laugh
at her, and to cry over him, I was quite
carried out of myself, and away from my
own Troubles. Towards Day-dawn they
both became quiet; I fumigated the
Room, bathed their Temples with Vinegar,
moistened their Mouths, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>knelt down in a Corner to pray; after
which, I dozed a little. I had heard the
Death-cart going its melancholy Round
during the Night; and had felt thankful
we had no Dead to be carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Morning, both my Patients
seemed bettering. <i>Dorcas</i>, with my Help,
got to her Master’s Bedside, and looked
in on him. “Dear Sir,” says she, “how
are you now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Somewhat easier, but very thirsty,
Mistress <i>Peach</i>,” says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh dear, Sir,” says she, “don’t call
me Mistress <i>Peach</i>, or I shall think
you’re going to die. I like <i>Dorcas</i> best
now. What a Mercy it was, Sir, Mistress
<i>Cherry</i> came in as she did, for we
were both at Death’s Door. I dare say,
Sir, you missed me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How should I do otherwise?” said
he, speaking very thick, and with evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Pain.... “I’ve got a Wasp’s Nest in
my Throat, I think.... How should
I do otherwise, I say, when no one
came near me for twenty-four Hours?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Sir,” says she, “I’m sure I beg
your Pardon for behaving so ill,—for
<i>being</i> so ill, that is; but indeed I could
not help it. I thought,” continues she,
turning to me, “I wouldn’t die, as ’twere,
just under his Nose, so crawled out of
Sight; but put Everything near him
that he could want before I took the
Liberty of leaving him; and did the
best Thing I could for him at parting,
by putting a fine drawing Plaster round
his Throat.... Pray, Sir, did it
draw?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Draw?” cries he, with the first indignant
Flash I ever saw from his pleasant
Eyes ... and ’twas half humourous, too,—“Like
a Cart-horse! I should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>been dead Hours ago, you Woman, had
I kept it on!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sorrowful as I was, I could not help
bursting out a-laughing, and he did so
too, when suddenly stopping short and
looking very odd,—“I don’t know whatever
has given way in my Throat,”
says he, “but verily I think that Laugh
has saved me! Here! give me some
Water, or Milk, or Anything to drink,
for I can swallow now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I gave him some Water, and ran
down Stairs for some Milk, the Night-watchman
having promised to set some
within the Door. When I got back,
there was quite another Expression on his
Face; composed and thankful. <i>Dorcas</i>
was shedding Tears as she tended him,
quite thoughtless of herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, <i>Cherry</i>,” says he, “do persuade
this dear Woman to lie down and take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Care of herself, for she has had Faith
enough in her famous Plasters to have
put one about her own Throat, and I
know what she must be suffering, or
will have to suffer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I gently led her back to her Mattress,
and then, sitting down by Master
<i>Blower</i>, fed him with some Sponge-cake
that was none the worse for being stale
when sopped in Milk, warm from the
Cow. He took it with great Satisfaction,
and said he hoped I should not think
him greedy when I remembered how
long he had fasted. Then he would not
be peaceified till I went down Stairs and
breakfasted by myself: telling me his
Mind to him a Kingdom was, or somewhat
to that Effect, which I could
thoroughly believe. When I came back,
<i>Dorcas</i> seemed sleeping soundly, though
not very easily. Master <i>Blower</i> had got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the same heavenly Look as when I first
saw him. I asked him if there were
Anything I could do for him. He said,
Yes, I could read him the fortieth Psalm.
When I had done so, he said, “And now
you can read me the hundred and sixteenth.”
That, he said, would do to
reflect upon, and I might go my Ways
now; he should want Nothing more for
a good While. So I sat down in a great
Arm-chair with a tall Back, wherein, the
Chair being mighty comfortable, and I
somewhat o’erwearied with watching,
(not being very strong yet,) or ever I
was aware I fell asleep, which certainly
was not very good Nursing nor good
Manners.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I woke up, which may perhaps
have been not so soon as it seemed to me,
“Well, Mistress <i>Cherry</i>,” says Master
<i>Blower</i>, somewhat ironically, “I hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>you have had a good Nap. A Penny
for your Dream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said it had been a wonderful pleasant
one ... too wonderful, I feared, to come
true.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, let’s have it, nevertheless,” says
he; “I like hearing wonderful Dreams
sometimes, when I’ve Nothing better
to do. So, now for it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>—When I came to think it over,
however, it seemed so different, waking
and sleeping, that I despaired of making
it seem to him Anything like what it
had seemed to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come,” said he, “you’re making a
new one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh no, Sir!” said I, “I would
not do such a Thing on any Account.—My
Dream was this;—only
I fear you’ll call it a comical one....
Methought I was walking with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>you, Sir, (I beg your Pardon for
dreaming of you, which I should not
have done if I had not been nursing
of you, I dare say)——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon’s granted,” says he. “Go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought, Sir, I was walking with
you in a Garden all full of Roses,
Pinks, Crownations, Columbines, Jolly-flowers,
Heartsease, and—and....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A Kiss behind the Garden-gate,”
says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was quite thrown out; and said,
I did not believe there was such a
Flower.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh yes, there is,” says he,—“Well
but the rest of your Dream——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>All?</i>” cries he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Sir; only that we went on
walking and walking, and the Garden
was so mighty pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Why, you told me there was Something
wonderful in it!” says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said it <i>had</i> seemed wonderful at
the Time——</p>

<p class='c013'>“That there was <i>not</i> a Kiss behind
the Garden-gate,” says he, laughing.
“O fie, <i>Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I felt quite ashamed; and said it
was very silly to tell Dreams, or to
believe in them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, yes,” said he seriously, “it <i>is</i>
foolish to believe in the disjointed
Images thrown together by a distempered
Fancy; though aforetime
it oft pleased our <span class='sc'>Heavenly Father</span>
to communicate his Will to his Servants
through the Avenues of their
sleeping Senses. How should you
and I be walking in a Garden together?
There are no Gardens in
<i>Whitechapel, Cherry</i>. In <i>Berkshire</i>, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>my Brother the Squire has a
Garden something like what you describe,
full of Roses, Pinks, and Gilly-flowers,
with great, flourished iron
Gates, and broad, turfen Walks, and
Arbours, like green Wigs, and clipped
Hedges full of Snails, and Ponds full
of Fish. If I go down there to get
well, <i>Cherry</i>, as peradventure I may,
for I shall want setting up again
before I’m fit for Work—(I’ve fallen
away till I’m as thin as <i>Don Quixote</i>!)
I’ll ask his Wife to invite you down,
<i>Cherry</i>, to see the Garden; and then
we’ll look up all those Flowers we
were talking about.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you kindly, Sir,” said I,
sorrowfully, “but I don’t think I can
go.... I must be looking for my
Father.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your Father!” cries he, in Amaze.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Why, dear <i>Cherry</i>, I thought you told
me he was dead!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I tried to answer him, but could not,
and fell a-sobbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come,” says he, quite moved, “I
want to hear all this sad Story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When I was composed enough to tell
it him, he listened with deep Attention,
and I saw a Tear steal down his Cheek.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry</i>,” says he at length, “you must
give over hoping he will return, my
Dear. There is not a Likelihood of it.
Consider how long a Time has elapsed
since he went forth; and how many, as
dear to their Families as your Father to
you, have been cut off in the Streets at
a Moment’s Notice, and carried off to
the Dead-pits before they were recognised.
For such awful Casualties the
Good are not unprepared. Instead of
carrying back Infection and Desolation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>to his Home, and lingering for Hours
and Days in unspeakable Agonies, the
good Man was doubtless carried at
once to the Bosom of his <span class='sc'>God</span>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he spake Words that killed
Hope, and yet brought Healing; and
after weeping long and plentifully, I
began to see Things as he did, and to
feel convinced I should see my Father’s
Face no more: which, indeed, I never
did.</p>

DORCAS, who continued
very ill all this Day, began
thereafter to amend, and
was able to take the sole
Night-watch. But the
Watchman would not let me go forth,
though he would send my Messages to
<i>Violet</i>, and give me the Packages of
Clothing and so forth that <i>Violet</i> sent me.
However, one Day a Doctor called, and
gave as his Reason for not coming before,
that he had been ill himself. And he
said both my Patients were in such a fair
Way of Recovery, that he thought in
another Week I might leave the House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>without Danger to myself or others, only
attending to the proper Fumigations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Master <i>Blower</i> now sat up in his easy
Chair, half wakeful, half dozing, for he
was too weak to read much. But he
liked me to read to him, which I did for
Hours together; and the Subject-matter
of the Book often gave Rise to much
pleasant Talk, insomuch that I began to
be secretly and selfishly sorry that the
Time was so near at Hand when he
would be well enough to do without
me.</p>

<p class='c013'>At other Times I got him to talk
to me about the Country-house of his
Brother, the Squire, wherein he himself
had been born, and had spent all his
boyish Days. And when I heard him
tell about the little ivy-covered Church,
and the pretty Churchyard planted with
Flowers, and the rustic Congregation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>their red Cloaks and white Frocks, and
the Village Choir with their Pipes and
Rebecks, it seemed to me I would rather,
a thousand Times, be Vicar or even
Curate of such a Place as that than have
ever such a large, grand Living in <i>Whitechapel</i>.
And so I told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>At other Times I sat sewing quite
silent by the Window, leaving him to
doze if he could; and sometimes I could
see without looking up, that his Eye
would rest on me for a good While at
a Time. I did not care a Pin about it,
and made as though I took no Notice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry</i>,” says he, after one of these
Ruminations, “what have the Men been
about that you have never got married?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I plucked up my Spirit on this; and,
“Sir,” said I, “if you can tell me of
any suitable Answer I can possibly
make to such a Question as that, I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>be much obliged to you for it, and
will make Use of it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well!” says he, “it <i>was</i> a queer
Question ... only, the Thing seems
so wonderful to me! Such a pretty
Girl as you were when I first knew
you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, that was a long While ago,
Sir,” said I, threading my Needle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was!” said he, decidedly; and
then looking at me in an amused Kind
of Way, to see how I took it. “A long
While ago, as you say, <i>Cherry</i>! And,
do you know, I think exactly the same
of you now, that I did then!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am very much obliged to you,
Sir,” said I; and went to make him a
Bread-pudding.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another Time, we fell to talking about
the Awfulness of the Visitation, which,
he said, he feared would make no lasting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Impression on the People. And he spoke
much about individual Sins helping to
bring down national Chastisements; and
individual Intercessions and Supplications
inviting Forgiveness of general Transgressions;
quoting <i>Daniel</i>, and <i>Abraham</i>,
and <i>Jeremiah</i>, “Run ye to and fro through
the Streets of <i>Jerusalem</i>, and see now
and know, and seek in the broad Places
thereof, if ye can find a Man that
executeth Judgment, that seeketh the
Truth; and I will pardon it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Another Time, feeling weaker than
common, he began to despond about getting
down to his Brother the Squire’s.
I said, “Dear Sir, if you are not equal
to so long a Journey, you can come,
for Change of Air, to your old Quarters
on the Bridge.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, <i>Cherry</i>,” said he, faintly smiling,
“what would Folks say if I did that?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Why, what <i>should</i> they say, Sir?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not considering what they <i>should</i>
say,” said he; “what they <i>would</i> say,
<i>Cherry</i>, would probably be, that I meant
to marry you; or ought to mean it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said I did not suppose they would
or could say any such Thing; I being
so long known on the Bridge,—and he
of his Years——</p>

<p class='c013'>“Humph!” said he, “I am but forty-four!
To hear you talk, one might
think I was a—” ... I forget what
Sort of an Arian he called himself,—“Do
you know what that means, <i>Cherry</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, I believed it was some Sort of
a Dissenter. On which he laughed outright;
and said it meant sixty or seventy
Years of Age, I forget which.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I’m not quite such an old Codger
as that,” said he, “so I won’t accept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>your kind Invitation, though I thank
you heartily for it. But we must not
let our Good be evil spoken of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this was spoken in such a simple,
genial, attaching Sort of a Way,—for his
Manners were always gentle and well-nurtured,—that
it only went to make me
like him more and more, and think what
a Privilege it was to be thus in hourly
Communion with Master <i>Blower</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Parting Time came at last. It was my
own Fault if I left not that House a
wiser, better, and happier Woman. <i>Dorcas</i>
and I saw him start off for <i>Berkshire</i>;
and there was a Tear in my Eye, when
he took my Hand to bid me Farewell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry</i>,” said he, still holding my
Hand, and looking at me with great
Goodness and Sweetness, “I shall never
forget that to you, under Heaven, I
owe my Life. And, by the Way, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>is Something I have often thought of
naming to you, only that it never
occurred to me at the proper Time
... a very odd Circumstance.—When
I escaped to <i>Holland</i>, and, as some
People thought, was in Want of Money,
I found seven gold Pieces in the Inside
of one of my Slippers! Who could
have put them there, do you think?
Ah, <i>Cherry</i>!—There! <span class='sc'>God</span> bless
you!”</p>

WHEN I returned Home,
my Neighbours looked
strangely on me, as though
I were one risen from the
Dead, after nursing two
People through the Plague without Hurt.
I said not much, however, to any of them
except to <i>Violet</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I had told her all I had to tell,
she said, “Well, I think the Tale ends
rather flatly: you and Master <i>Blower</i>
might as well have made a Match
of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Truly, <i>Violet</i>,” said I, “I think Women
of our age may be capable of a disinterested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Action, without Question of
Matchmaking.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As to Women of <i>our</i> Age,” retorted
she, “speak for yourself, if you please!
You may make out yourself to be as
old as you will; but I mean to stick
at Twenty-eight!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said not another Word, but secretly
wondered how strangely tender some
People are on the Subject of Age. Even
Master <i>Blower</i>, who had owned to Forty-four,
did not like me to reckon him at
Fifty.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now quite the latter End of
<i>October</i>, the Distemper was abating, and
People were beginning to venture back
to their Homes, and a few Shops were
re-opened. <i>Hugh Braidfoot</i> and his
Family returned among the rest. But
too heedless an Exposure to the Infection
yet lingering among us caused the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Distemper to rage again with great Fury
before it abated for good.</p>

<p class='c013'>I now kept myself close, and spent
the Chief of the Day at my Needle or
Book, working much for the Poor, who
were like enough to be destitute in the
Winter. First, however, I put on
Mourning for my poor, dear Father,
whom I could not bear to deny this
Mark of Remembrance, though the
Mortality being so great, People had
quite left off wearing Black for their
Friends. Much he dwelt in my sad,
solitary Thoughts; and when they ran
not on him, they chiefly settled on
Master <i>Blower</i>. The more I considered
their Characters, the more Beauty I
found in them.</p>

<p class='c013'>I never opened the Shop-shutters now,
except for a little Light. Trade was
utterly stagnant; and my Father’s Business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>had dropped with him. The little
I might have done in the Perfumery
Line, had the Town not been empty,
would not have been worth speaking
of: it was a Mercy, therefore, that my
dear Father had left me well provided.</p>

<p class='c013'>One Evening, when it was getting
too dusk to work or read, and I was
falling into a Muse, a tall Shadow
darkened the Door, which happened to
be ajar, and the next Moment a Man
whom I did not immediately recognise,
entered the Parlour and stepped up
to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry!</i> dear <i>Cherry</i>!” he said in
a stifled Voice, and took me in his Arms
with a Brother’s Affection. It was poor
<i>Mark</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear <i>Mark</i>!” I said, “where <i>have</i>
you been? Oh, how often have I
thought of you!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“Aye, <i>Cherry</i>, well you might, and
pray for me, too,” said he, somewhat
wildly. “Oh, what a Tale I have
to tell you!—You will either hate
or despise me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are ill, very ill,” said I, looking
fearfully at his haggard Face; “let me
give you Something before you say
another Word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wine, then,” said he; and drank
with avidity the Glass I poured out, and
then filled it again himself. “Thanks,
dear <i>Cherry</i>!—will my Uncle be
coming in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked at him and at my Dress,
and could not speak; but there was
no need—“Ah!”—said he; and wrung
my Hand, and then dropped it.</p>

<div id='i212'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i212.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry</i>,” said he, after a Moment’s
Pause, “you know how afraid I was of
the Plague, and how my Wife taunted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>me for it, and for taking the commonest
Precautions. She herself braved it,
defied it; secure in her Amulet and
Fortune-telling. What was worse, she
cruelly exposed her Servants to it, for
the merest Trifles. We had Words
about it often: bitter Words, at last—She
accused me, utterly without Foundation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of caring more for the Servant-girl
than for her, reviled me for tempting
my own Fate by Fear; finally, said
I should be no great Loss, for I had
never cared much for her, nor she for
me. All this embittered me against
her. Well, the poor Maid caught the
Plague at the Butchers’ Stalls, and, the
next Night, was in the Dead-cart. The
following Day, our youngest ’Prentice
died. The other decamped in the
Night. I now became nearly Mad
with Fear and Anger; and, finding
my Wife would not stir, or at least,
as she said, ‘not yet,’ I considered that
Self-preservation was the first Law of
Nature; and, taking a good Supply of
Money with me, I left the House in the
Night. Fear of being driven back was
my sole Feeling till I got clear out of
<i>London</i>; then, I began to have an Impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>I had done wrong. But ’twas
Death, ’twas Madness to think of turning
back. On I went....</p>

<p class='c013'>“It had been my Impression, <i>Cherry</i>,
that, with plenty of Money in my
Pocket, I could make my Way wherever
I would; but now, in whatever
Direction I went, I came upon a
Watchman, who, because I had no
Clean Bill of Health to show, would
not let me pass. At length, after running
hither and thither, throughout the
Night, I came upon a couple of Men,
with a small Cart and Horse. They
seemed to be in the same Strait as myself,
and talked of fetching a Compass
to <i>Bow</i>. I asked them to let me join
them, and they consented. They were
a rough Sort of Fellows; one it seemed
had deserted his Mother, the other his
Wife. Their Conduct, and their brutal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Way of talking of it, only made mine
seem more ugly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On <i>Bow Bridge</i> the Watch would
have questioned us, but we crossed the
Road into a narrow Way leading to
<i>Old Ford</i>. Afterwards we got on to
<i>Homerton</i> and <i>Hackney</i>, and at length
into the northern Road. Here we went
on till we saw some Men running towards
us; then we struck into a Lane,
halted at a Barn, and had some Bread
and Cheese. The Food was theirs, but
I paid for my Share; and I saw them
curiously eyeing my Money. Afterwards
they asked one or two Questions
about my Resources, which I did not
much like.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we kept on till we were many
Miles from <i>London</i>, occasionally dodging
Villages and Constables. At Nightfall
we reached the Skirt of a Wood.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Here my Companions proposed to sleep;
but as soon as they were fairly off, I
stole away. I wandered a long Way
from them in the Wood; at length
took refuge in a Cow-shed. I thought
I heard Voices, not far off, which made
me uneasy; however, I was so tired
that I fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As soon as Day dawned, I made off;
and, not knowing which Track to take,
went on at Random, till I came to a
large old Barn. To my Surprise, I
heard some one praying within. I
looked in, and saw, not one, but a
dozen Men, and two or three Women
and Children. I stood reverently aside
till the old Man had done, and heard
him pray that they might all continue
to be spared from the awful Visitation.
When they uncovered their Faces, I
stept forward, on which there was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>loud Cry, and they warned me off. It
was to no Use speaking, they would
not hear me as I had no Passport.
Dispirited and hungry, I strayed away
till I came to the Skirt of the Wood,
in Sight of a Cluster of Houses. I was
about to make for them, when three
Men, with a Pitchfork, Bludgeon, and
Horsewhip, rushed upon me and collared
me, saying, ‘Here’s one of them!’—I
struggled, and said, ‘One of whom?
I belong to no Party, and am a healthy,
innocent Man.’ ‘That sounds well,’
said one of them, ‘but we guess you are
one of a Gang that, after threatening
and intimidating our Town yesterday,
broke into a lone Farmhouse last Night;
so we’ll take you before a Magistrate.’
‘Do so,’ said I, ‘for it will be better
than starving in the Wood, and I shall
be able to clear myself.’ So, after a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Time, finding I made no Resistance,
they gave over dragging me, and let
me walk by myself, only keeping close
about me, with an ugly Bull-dog at my
Heels. However, I did not feel over-sure,
<i>Cherry</i>, that my Story would satisfy
the Magistrate, so when we reached a
small Public-house where we found a
Constable, I privately slipped a Half-crown
into his Hand, and he, after a little
Parley, gave it as his Opinion that I
was an honest Man, whereon the others
desisted from giving me in Charge.
But they would by no Means admit me
into the House, only brought out some
Bread and Beer and set them at a Distance,
and then went away while I ate
and drank.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There seemed nothing to do but to
turn again into the Wood; and as I
was without Object, foot-sore, and spiritless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>I paused at the first inviting Spot I
came to, and cast myself along under a
Tree. Here I suppose I slept a good
While: when I awoke, it was with a
strange Sense of Depression, and it
occurred to me I might be plague-stricken
after all. As if I could fly yet
from the Distemper, if that were the
Case, I resolved to be moving; for I
had no Mind to die like a Rat in a
Hole. Just then I heard Voices close
on the other Side the Tree; and, eyeing
the Speakers between the Branches,
could make out a numerous Band of
Men and a few Women, who were
eating and drinking. I did not like
their Appearance much, and thought
of retreating, when one of them, seeing
me stir, cries,—‘A Spy!’ and drags me
into the Midst. I was pretty roughly
handled till they settled it to their Minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>I was a harmless Sort of a Fellow; and
then they told me they would let me
join the Crew if I would cast my Lot
among them, and put whatever I had
about me into the common Stock. I
was no Ways minded to do this; however,
I gave them a few Shillings,
which, after a little Demur, they took,
and I then was free of the Company. I
soon had Reason to apprehend they
were the Band who had affrighted the
Townsmen the Day before, and plundered
the Farm in the Night; and it
seemed as if a select Council of them
were concerting Something of the Sort
again, though they did not invite me
to participate. As this was not the Sort
of Company I had any Mind to associate
with, I dragged through the Afternoon
and Evening as well as I could, mostly
apart. They then began to put up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Booths and Tents for the Night, at
which I was glad to assist, rather than
do Nothing; but I lay a little Way off,
under a Tree. In the Night I felt
some one lugging at the little Parcel of
Clothing I laid my Head upon.—I hit
a Blow at Random, which made whoever
it was move off without a Word;
and then I thought it was Time for me
to move off too. I got away unperceived,
and could not settle again all
Night. When Day broke, I was in a
Part of the Forest that was new to me....
The Sun was shining on some
gnarled old Oaks, and along green
Glades; there were Birds singing, Hares
running across the Grass, and Wildflowers
overhanging a little Brook of
clear Water. Oh, <i>Cherry</i>! how I
should have enjoyed idling in such a
Place if I had had a quiet Mind!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“I drank some Water, and washed my
Face; and just then I saw some Women
passing through the Trees, carrying
large, country Loaves, and tin Cans of
Milk. They did not see me, but set
down their Burthens near a large Stone.
Then they retreated and stood a little
Way off, and presently, two pretty-looking
Girls came tripping out of the
Wood, took up the Loaves, emptied the
Milk into brown Pitchers of their own,
put some Silver on the Stone, and cried,
‘Here’s your Money, good People!’”</p>

<div id='i222'  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i222.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Then they returned into the Wood,
and I followed them. I said, ‘Shall I
carry one of your Pitchers?’ They
looked affrighted, and cried, ‘Pray, Sir,
keep off ... how do we know that
you may not have the Plague?’ I said,
‘I assure you, it was to escape from the
Plague that I came into the Wood, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>here I seem likely to starve, though I
have Plenty of Money.’ They looked
at one another, and said, ‘If it be true,
his Case is hard,—let us tell my Father.’
They went away, and by and by an
elderly Man came to me from among
the Trees. He questioned me very
narrowly, and satisfying himself at
length that I was both sound and respectable,
he admitted me to their little
Encampment, which consisted of five
or six little Huts, a Family in each;
besides a few Cabins the single Men
had set up for themselves. I did the
like, added my Stock to theirs, and
continued with them all the Time their
Encampment lasted, which was till
Yesterday, when, the Weather turning
cold, and the News of the Abatement
of the Distemper having reached us, we
resolved to return to our Homes.—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>could make you quite in Love with our
Camp Life, <i>Cherry</i>, if I chose to enlarge
upon some Things, and leave others out
of Sight,—in short, make it appear the
Thing it was not. But, honestly speaking,
though we were very thankful to
buy our Safety at the Price of much
Inconvenience, all the Romance of our
Situation soon faded away, and we were
right glad to set our Faces homewards
again, even without being fully certified
we could do so with Impunity.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, to what a Home did I return!
The House was padlocked up, and
Everything in the Possession of the
<i>Lord Mayor</i>. And, from a Watchman
out of Employ, who was taking Care
of a House over the Way, and who
did not know me, I heard the Circumstances
of my Wife’s frightful Death.
Oh, <i>Cherry</i>! we did not care for each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>other much; but I fear it was cowardly
and cruel of me to forsake her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>—And <i>Mark</i> laid his Head on his
Arms and wept. Presently he said,
“What to do, I know not. I shall be
able, by Application to the <i>Lord Mayor</i>
to-morrow, to get back my House and
Property; but—to tell you the Truth—I
have no great Fancy to go back
there; at any Rate, till the House has
been well fumigated. So that ... will
you take Compassion on me, and let
me return awhile to my old Quarters,
<i>Cherry</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course I said I would.</p>

IT was now Supper-time;
and <i>Mark</i>, having lessened
the Sense of his Troubles
by telling of them, although
he began by
thinking he could not eat a Mouthful,
ended by making a very hearty Supper.
Indeed, he so much commended the
one or two simple Dishes set upon
Table, and spoke so strongly, though
briefly, on the Subject of good and bad
Cookery, that, as it had been his Disposition
to be contented with Anything
that was set before him in his unmarried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Days, I set it all down to the Discomfort
of his late Life in the Forest. Afterwards
I was disposed to change my
Mind about this, and to decide that
Mistress <i>Blenkinsop</i>, who in their early
married Days had pampered and petted
him amazingly, (whereby his good Looks
had suffered no little,) had really destroyed
the simple Tastes which were
once so becoming in him, and had made
him Something of an Epicure.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the Table was cleared, he drew
near me again, and with real Concern
in his Manner, pressed me to tell him
about my Father. I did so from first
to last, with many Tears; adding thereunto
my nursing of Master <i>Blower</i>. He
sighed a good many Times as I went
on, and after I had done; exclaiming
at last, “What a Difference between you
and me!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“All People have not the same Qualifications,”
said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said he, and seemed to think
I had now hit the right Nail on the
Head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And <i>Violet</i>——” said he, after a
Pause, and colouring deeply. “Is she
quite well, <i>Cherry</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quite,” I said; and could think of
Nothing more to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” said he in a low Voice,
as if he were almost afraid to hear the
Echo of his own Thoughts, “whether
she would now have Anything to say
to me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, looking away from him, “Such
Questions as that should only be put to
the Parties concerned.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are right,” said he; and sat
a long While silent, leaning his Head
upon his Hand. At length, he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“I am rich now, and she is poor,
<i>Cherry</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Riches and Poverty don’t
make much Difference, <i>Mark</i>, when
People really love one another.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I have loved—” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “It is Bed-time now, and here
is <i>Dolly</i> coming in to Prayers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The next Morning, he said he must
go to the <i>Lord Mayor</i> about his House.
For the abandoned Effects of such Families
as were entirely swept away and left
no known Heirs, went to the <i>King</i>, who
made them over to the <i>Lord Mayor</i> and
<i>Aldermen</i>, to be applied to the Use of
the Poor; and <i>Mark’s</i> Absence had made
it appear that his Property was in that
Case.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after he was gone, the uncommon,
and, I may almost say, unparalleled Event
occurred to me of receiving a Letter; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>was so surprised at the Circumstance,
that for the Moment, I thought it must
be <i>from my Father</i>; or, at least, to tell
me he was alive. But no, it was from
Master <i>Blower</i>; and this was what he
put in it:</p>

<div id='i231'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i231.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='c018'>“<i>Bucklands Hall, Berks.</i></div>
<div class='c019'>“<i>Oct. 27, 1665.</i></div>

<p class='c020'>“Dear Mistress <i>Cherry</i>,</p>
<p class='c021'>“On first coming down
here, I was so ill at Ease and out of
Sorts, as to require much Care and
Nursing. Heaven be praised, I am
now well, and I hope you are the same.
Though the Pinks and Gilly-flowers
are pretty well over, there are still some
gay Autumn Flowers in the old Garden
with the Iron Gate; and my Brother,
the Squire, and his good Wife want
to see the brave Mistress <i>Cherry</i> who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>nursed me through the Plague. So
come down to us, dear <i>Cherry</i>, to-morrow,
if you can. <i>John</i>, the Coachman
(a steady Man), will be at your
Door, with a white Horse and a Pillion,
at Seven o’ the Clock. And be so
good, if it will not be inconvenient to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>you, as to bring my Sister-in-Law a
little Mace and green Ginger; and
also (on my Account) one of those
Saffron-cakes they used to be so famous
for at the Bridge foot.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Your faithful and obliged Friend,</p>
<div class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Nathanael Blower</span>.</div>

<p class='c020'>“If you don’t come, you must write.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was an Event! An Invitation
to the Country was a still more startling
Occurrence than the Receipt of a Letter.
Many of the Circumstances connected
with it were delightful; but then, it
seemed so strange, so awful, to go to
stay with People I had never seen, ...
such grand People, too! I that was so
unused to fine Company, and did not
know how to behave!—And Master
<i>Blower</i> knew all this, knew exactly what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>I was, and yet had prevailed with them
to say they should be happy to see me!—Oh,
his Goodness of Heart had this
Time carried him too far! They had
said so just to please him, without expecting
I should go!—And yet, if the
Lady were <i>very</i> much put to it for Mace
and green Ginger.... And if Master
<i>Blower’s</i> Heart were very much set upon
giving her the Saffron-cake.... I supposed
I had better go. If I found myself
very much out of Place, I could come
away the next Day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I thought I would go and consult
<i>Violet</i>; for, in Fact, I wanted a little
persuading to do what I very much liked.
So I stepped across the Bridge. The
Shop was open, but nobody was in it;
so I went to the Parlour Door, and
opened it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Directly I had done so, I saw <i>Violet</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and <i>Mark</i>, sitting close together, their
Backs to me, and his Arm round her
Waist. I closed the Door so softly that
they did not know it had been opened,
and went Home. A Pang shot through
my Heart. It was entirely on their own
Accounts, for I had ceased, for Years, to
have Anything but a most sisterly Concern
in him; and his Character, compared
with those of the People I had
most loved, failed to stand the Test: but
I thought this was too quick, too sudden,
to be quite comely or decent; there was
too much Passion, too little Self-respect.</p>

<p class='c013'>I now made up my Mind without any
more Hesitation, that I would go into the
Country. I gave my parting Directions
to <i>Dolly</i>, and desired her to let <i>Mark</i>
have Things comfortable. Then I made
up my little Travelling-equipage, not
forgetting my Commissions. Being in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>fresh, well-made Mourning, there was
no Trouble or Anxiety about Dress. I
quite enjoyed the pleasing Bustle of Preparation,
though I did not expect to be
absent longer than a Week.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Mark</i> was not very punctual to the
Supper-hour; and as he said Nothing of
his Visit over the Way, I was to conclude
him all Day at my <i>Lord Mayor’s</i> or in
<i>Cheapside</i>. But the deep Carmine of his
Cheek and the burning Light of his Eye,
told Tales. I asked him if he had dined.
He carelessly replied yes, with a Friend.
I asked him if he had seen the <i>Lord
Mayor</i>. He said yes, it had been a more
troublesome Business than he expected:
they had asked him so many searching
Questions, and had got the whole Story
out of him. He feared he had cut a
sorry Figure. At any Rate, he had in his
own Sight. Then I asked him whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>he had got back his House. He said yes,
and had put an old Woman into it, who
had undertaken to fumigate it. Everything
seemed sealed up, but he could not
help fearing many Things were gone.
The old Place looked so dismal, he came
away as soon as he could.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a Pause, he said, “<i>Cherry</i>, I feel
a strong Inclination to get rid of that
Concern altogether. The Situation is
capital, and I shall get Something for
the Business; but I have a great Mind
to set up somewhere else; and though
your Father’s was a much smaller Business
than ours, yet my happiest Hours
have been passed under this Roof; and
if you like to give up the Shop to me,
I will give for it whatever I get for my
own. And you can still live with us....
I mean, we can still live here together.
What say you, <i>Cherry</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>I said, “Dear <i>Mark</i>, I have no Wish
to receive for these Premises what you
get for your own. The Shop you are
welcome to; the Business you will
have to remake for yourself, for it has
dwindled quite away; I shall be very
glad to continue to live with you as
long as you like to have me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We ... I shall <i>always</i> like to have
you, <i>Cherry</i>,” said he, “for there is
only one Person dearer to me in the
whole World.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Father has left me so comfortably
provided,” said I, “that I
shall never need to be a Burthen on
any one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am glad of it for your own Sake,”
returned he; “but, as to my taking up
the Business without paying for it, that
is not to be thought of. Whatever I
get for mine, you shall have for yours.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“So let it stand at present, at any
Rate,” said I. “Henceforth, the Shop
is yours. And, <i>Mark</i>, you will have
the whole House to yourself to-morrow,
for I am going into the
Country.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where?” said he, opening his Eyes
very wide.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To <i>Bucklands Hall</i>, in <i>Berkshire</i>; to
stay with Master ... with Squire and
Mistress <i>Blower</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A broad Smile spread over his Face.
“I am very glad indeed to hear of it,
<i>Cherry</i>,” said he.—“<i>Very</i> glad of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Afterwards, as we sat chatting over
our Supper, we got on the Subject of
Ghosts. He asked me if I believed in
them. I said no.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I do,” said he, sighing. And
told me of a Story he had had from
the Servant of Sir <i>Richard Hart</i>, who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>travelling with his Master, had been
summoned by him early one Morning,
and charged to ride Home with all
Speed, a Distance of seventeen Miles, and
see how fared his Daughter, whom he
conceited to have seen in the Night,
standing at his Bed-foot, with her Hand
pressed to her Head. The Man rode
back as he was told; and returned with
the News that the young Lady had
indeed been taken ill about four o’Clock
that Morning, but had had a Doctor
with her, and was now pretty well
again. However, in the Course of the
Day she died.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Her Father, in a Dream, may
have had so strong an Impression he
was waking, that to him it had all the
Effect of being awake.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But such a Dream as should so raise
the Dead, or pre-figure their Death,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span><i>Cherry</i>,” said <i>Mark</i>, “would be as bad
as if they <i>were</i> raised—to <i>us</i>.... I
think I, for one, could not stand it.”
And I saw then why he was afraid to
return to his own House.</p>

<p class='c013'>We talked the Matter quietly over
for some Time; and I asked him why,
if the Course taken by Divine Providence
in the Administration of human Affairs
ever admitted of the Re-appearance of
the Dead, the recorded Cases of such
supposed Appearances should only be to
frighten some timid Person, restore a Bag
of Gold, or acquaint some one with what
they would otherwise know a few Hours
after. This appeared to strike him; but he
said it might be for the Sake of Warning.
I said, If for Warning, why not for Comfort?
How glad should I have been, for
Instance, to be informed supernaturally
that all was well with my Father? He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>said, not <i>that</i> Way, surely. I replied yes,
that Way or any Way that it had pleased
the <span class='sc'>Almighty</span> to vouchsafe me such
Knowledge. I should not be afraid (and
there was an Intensity of Earnestness in
me as I said it) to see either him or
my Mother, either in or out of the
Body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” muttered he, half under his
Breath, “I wish I could feel as much
with regard to my Wife.” And, regarding
me with some Earnestness,
added, “You’re a bold little Thing,
<i>Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As I wished him Good-night, he
stayed me for a Moment, and said, with
all his old Frankness and Trust, “<i>Violet</i>
and I have made Things out between
us, <i>Cherry</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said fervently, “Then, may you both
be happy. My Belief is, that she is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>likelier to make you happy now, than
she was before.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not quite so pretty, though,” said
he, rather regretfully. “However, I
don’t mind that.—For, you see, <i>Cherry,
I love her</i>!”</p>

DOLLY and I had spent great
Part of the Afternoon in
brushing up and cleaning
an old black riding Skirt of
my Mother’s, which it was
a Wonder I had not cut up into Garments
for the Poor. When we had cleaned it
with Hollands, and ironed it nicely, it
looked very well; for our House was so
airy, that our Clothes never had the
Moth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Precisely at the Hour named, an old
Man in purple Livery rode up to the
Door, on a grey Horse with a Pillion.
<i>Mark</i>, who was very lively this Morning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>told me he thought the Horse looked
like a Bolter; but I knew he was only
laughing at me. Then he asked me
how I meant to mount; I said, with a
Chair, to be sure. He said, “Nonsense!”
and lifted me up in a Moment, and
arranged my Riding-skirt as nicely as if
he had been a Lady’s Groom. Then he
told the old Man to be careful of me;
but the old Coachman proved to be both
dull and deaf, by reason of great Age;
so <i>Mark</i> whispered me that he was not
afraid of his running away with me, if
the Horse did not; finishing with “Good-bye,
<i>Mistress Blower</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I gave him an indignant Look, and
said, “For shame, <i>Mark</i>! I have not
deserved that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said he, “<i>I</i> think you <i>have</i>.”
And just then the old Man jerked the
Rein of the old Horse, which moved off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>so suddenly, that I was fain to catch hold
of the old Man’s Coat; and the last
Glance I had of <i>Mark</i> was a merry one.</p>

<p class='c013'>At first I felt a little bit frightened;
but soon got used to my new Position;
especially as the Horse walked till we
were off the Stones. Still we seemed a
long while getting out of <i>London</i>; and
we met a great many People returning
to it, in Carts, Waggons, and Coaches.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length we got quite out of Town,
and between green Hedges, with Trees
beyond them that were turning all manner
of Colours; with only a House here
and there, or a Wayside Inn. At one
of the latter we stopped in the middle
of the Day, to rest the Horse, and take
some Refreshment. Then we continued
our Journey, which lasted till Sunset,
and the latter Part of which was mighty
pleasant and delightsome; only I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>beginning to be a little weary with so
much shaking. But, when I saw how
charming a Place the Country was, I
wondered how People could live in
Towns ... unless on a Bridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length we turned off the Highway
into a Bye-road, shaded with tall Trees,
which, after a Mile or two, brought us
to a straggling Village; and, says the
Coachman, “Mistress, now we’s in <i>Bucklands</i>.”
Presently we passed the absolutest
curiosity of a little old Church!...
it seemed hardly bigger than a
Nutmeg-grater!—and hard by it, the
old Parsonage, with three Stone Peaks
in front, and a great Pear-Tree before
the Door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we came to a Village Green,
with a Clump of large Trees in the
Midst, that had Seats round them, whereon
sat old Men, while young Men played
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Cricket, and little Boys were setting a
Puppy to bark at some white Geese.
Here we came to a great Iron Gate,
at which stood a hale, hearty-looking
Gentleman about fifty; square-built, and
not over-tall; with a good-humoured,
red, mottled Face. And, says he, coming
up to me, as we stopped, “Mistress
<i>Cherry</i>, I’m Squire <i>Blower</i>. I can guess
who you are, though my Brother did
not tell me you were such a pretty
Girl.—Oh, the Sinner!” And lifted
me off the Horse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” says he, “you don’t look quite
sure that I’s I.... I <i>am</i>, though!
Certainly, not much like <i>Nat</i>, who was
always the Beauty of the Family. Ah!
now you laugh, which was just what I
wanted. My Brother said your silver
Laugh saved his Life;—do you know
what he meant by that?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>We were now walking up a strait
gravel Walk, between clipped Hedges,
to an old red-brick House, with stone
Facings. “I suppose, Sir,” said I, after
thinking a little, “he meant that my
laughing was as good as Silver to him,
because it saved him the Doctor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was it, no doubt,” returns he;
“just such an Answer, Mistress <i>Cherry</i>,
as I expected. I see we shall get on
very well together, though <i>Nat</i> is not
here to help the Acquaintance.—He
has gone to see his old Foster-mother,
who is dying. People <i>will</i> die, you
know, when they get to eighty or
ninety.”</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>An old red-brick House</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We were now going up a Flight of
shallow Steps, with Stone Ballusters,
which led us into a Hall, paved with
great Diamonds of black and white
Marble, and hung about with Guns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Fishing-rods, and Stag’s Horns. An
Almanack and King <i>Charles’s</i> golden
Rules were pasted against the Wall; and
a stuffed Otter in a Glass Case hung over
the great Fire-place, where a Wood-fire
burned on the Hearth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before this Wood-fire was spread a
small <i>Turkey</i> Carpet; and on the Carpet
stood a Table and four heavy Chairs; in
one of which sat an old Lady knitting.
The Squire bluntly accosted her with
“Mother, here’s Mistress <i>Cherry</i>;” on
which she said, “Ho!”—laid down her
Knitting, and looked hard at me; first
over, and then through her Spectacles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hum!” says she, “Mistress <i>Cherry</i>,
you are welcome. A good Day to you.
Pray make yourself at Home, and be
seated.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I sat down over against her, and we
looked at each other very stiff. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>short and fat, with round blue Eyes, and
a rosy Complexion; and had a sharper,
shrewder Look than the Squire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dare say she’s hungry, Mother,”
says the Squire; “give her a Piece of
Gingerbread or Something.—How soon
shall we have Supper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are always in such a Hurry,
Father, to be eating;” says his Lady.
“Forsooth, are we not to wait for your
Brother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>And without waiting for his Answer,
she took a bunch of Keys from her
Apron-string, and unlocked a little Corner-cupboard,
from which she brought me a
Slice of rich Seed-cake, and a large Glass
of Wine.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Madam; I am not
hungry,” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pooh! Child, you must be;” returns
she, rather authoritatively. “Never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>be afraid of eating and drinking before
Company, as if it were a Crime!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So, thus admonished, I ate and drank:
though I would as lief have waited a
little.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you stiff with your Ride?” says
she.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A little, Madam,” said I; “for I was
ne’er on a Horse before.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it possible,” cries she, bursting out
a-laughing. “Father, did you hear that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Famous!” said he; and they eyed
me as if I were a Curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know, now,” says the Squire’s
Lady to me, after a while, “I never was
in <i>Lunnon</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That seems as strange to me, Madam,”
said I, “as it seems to you that I should
never have been on Horseback.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It <i>is</i> strange,” says she. “Both are
strange.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>“And now <i>I’ll</i> tell you Something
that is strange,” says the Squire, “since
we all seem surprising one another.
Do you know, Mistress <i>Cherry</i>,” stepping
up behind his Wife, and laying a
Hand on each of her Shoulders, while
he spoke to me over her Head, “that
this little round-about Woman was
once as pretty a Girl as you are?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stuff! Squire,” says his Lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fact!” persisted he. “Nay, prettier!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a Word of Truth in it,” says
she, shaking him off. “I was all very
well,—nothing more. Come, Father,
here’s <i>Gatty</i> going to spread the Cloth
for Supper, which you’ll be glad of.
But, <i>Gatty</i>, in the first Place shew
Mistress <i>Cherry</i> to her Chamber, ...
she will perhaps like to dress a little.
You’ll excuse my attending you, my
Dear; the Stairs try my Breath.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>I followed <i>Gatty</i> up Stairs to the prettiest
Room that ever was! When I
came down, the Cloth was spread, and
the Squire’s Lady signed me to the Chair
over against her, and was just going to
say Something, when, crossing between
me and the Sun, I saw the Shadow of a
Man against the Wall, and knew it for
Master <i>Blower’s</i>. Ah! what came over
me at that Moment, to make me so
stupid, I know not.—Perhaps that saucy
Saying of <i>Mark’s</i> ... but whatever it
was, instead of my going up to Master
<i>Blower</i>, when he came in, which he
did the next Moment, and asking him
simply and straitforwardly how he was,
I must needs colour all over like a
Goose, and wait till he came quite up
to me, without having a Word to say
for myself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, <i>Cherry</i>!” says he, taking my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Hand quite frankly, “how glad I am to
see you! Are you quite well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, the Moment I heard his pleasant
Voice, I was quite comfortable again,
and felt myself at Home for the first
Time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quite, thank you, Sir,” said I, “and
I hope you are better than you were.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, now that civil Things have
passed on both Sides,” said the Squire,
who had already seated himself, “come
and say Grace, <i>Nat</i>, for here’s a
Couple of beautiful Fowls getting
cold.”</p>

<p class='c013'>—Well, the Supper was as pleasant as
could be, and it was growing quite dusk
before the Table was cleared, yet the
Squire would not hear of having Candles;
so then his Lady desired <i>Gatty</i> to carry
Lights into the green Parlour, “Where,”
says she, “I and this young Person will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>retire, and be good enough Company
for each other, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh, I’m a young Person, am I?
thought I. So I followed her into the
green Parlour, where she settled herself
in an easy Chair, with her Feet on a
Footstool, and made me sit facing her.
“Now,” says she, “the Men can prose
by themselves, and we’ll have a Coze
by <i>our</i>selves. Pray, Child, how was
it you came to think of nursing my
Brother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I began to tell her how I went to
him in Hope of his telling me how to
find my Father; but then, she wanted to
know how my Father came to be missing,
so I had to go further back. And
then I could not help putting in by the
Way how good and excellent a Man he
was, how tender a Father, how loving a
Husband, which brought in my Mother.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>But I checked myself, and begged the
Lady’s Pardon for entering on that, which
I knew could no Ways interest her.—“Nay,
let me hear it all,” says she, “I
shall like to hear Something about your
Mother.” So then I told her of her
holy Life, and saintlike End; and of
Master <i>Blower’s</i> invaluable Ministrations,
which of course interested her a good
deal; and indeed I saw a Tear steal
down her Cheek, while I kept mine
down as well as I could. Then I went
on to the Plague, and my Father’s Heaviness
of Spirits; and his going forth and
never coming back, and my going in
quest of him, and all the Events of that
terrible Day, which I could not go over
without crying very heartily. She wept
too; yet cried, “Go on, go on!” So
then I got to Master <i>Blower</i>, and the
sleeping Watchman, and my getting into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the House, and going from Room to
Room, and hearing him yawn,—which
made her laugh; though she cried again
when she heard of his praying, and of
his Sufferings that fearful Night and
many Days after. At the End of all, she
got up, put her Arms about my Neck,
and kissed me. “<i>Cherry</i>,” says she,
“you’re an excellent Creature!”—Just
then, a great Bell began to ring,—“That’s
the Prayer-bell!” says she.
“We will return to the Hall, my
Dear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So we returned to the Hall, much more
at our Ease together than when we left
it. And there, standing in a Row, were
half a Dozen Men and Women Servants,
and the Table had Candles and a large
Bible on it. Master <i>Blower</i> read, and
then prayed: had I not been so tired,
I could have wished him to go on all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Night! Then we dispersed to our several
Chambers; and I had so much to think
about that it seemed as though I should
never get to sleep: however, I did at
last.</p>

BEFORE I went to Bed, I
peeped out of my Window,
and saw the full Moon
shining over the broad
gravel Walks and Fishponds;
and I thought how much I should
like to go round the Garden before Breakfast.
However, when I woke in the
Morning, I feared I had been oversleeping
myself, so dressed in a great Hurry,
and went down Stairs. There I found
two Maids flooding the great Hall with
Pails of Water, and they told me we were
to breakfast in the green Parlour, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>for an Hour yet. So I strayed out into
the Garden, where were still a good many
Flowers, though the Season was so late,
backed by Evergreen Hedges, and Rows
of tall Trees that were turning yellow
and scarlet; and it seemed to me just like
the Garden of <i>Eden</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>So I went on and on, thinking it
mighty pleasant, and wondering what
might be the Names of some of the
Flowers; and at length I came to a
Bowling-green, of wonderful fine Turf,
between high Horn-beam Hedges; and
having a Sun-dial at one End, and a little
brick Summer-house faced with Stone at
the other. Into the Summer-house I
went; and there, with all his Books and
Papers about him, sat Master <i>Blower</i>
writing.</p>

<div id='i260'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i260.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>A Bowling-Green of wonderful Fine Turf.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, <i>Cherry</i>!” says he, holding out
his Hand, “so you’ve found out my Snuggery!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Have they sent you to summon
me to Breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Sir,” said I, “I did not know
you were here.” And turned away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stop a Minute,” says he, hastily putting
up his Papers, “and we will take a
Turn together round this wonderful
Garden. The Garden of your <i>Dream,
Cherry</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said how very odd it was I should
have dreamed about it,—the Garden of
my Dream being so exactly like the
Reality.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you simple Girl,” says he,
laughing; “because I must have described
it to you before, though you
and I had forgotten it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I felt quite sure in my own Mind that
he had not.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” says he, setting out with me
along the Bowling-green, “what’s the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>News, <i>Cherry</i>? The Plague, you say,
is abating, but not gone. Have you
seen or heard Anything of my poor
People?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said yes. Mistress <i>Peach</i> had come
to me on my sending for her the Evening
before I left; and had told me
how Things were going on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how <i>are</i> they going on?”
said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Sir, it would be a poor Compliment
to you, if they were going
on as well in your Absence, as in your
Presence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s true,” says he, looking grave;
“but, for Particulars.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Many Persons in Trouble of one kind
or another, knock at your Door; and
when they find they cannot see you, go
away in Tears.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Souls!” said he, much moved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“I will return to them shortly. I think
I am almost well enough now, <i>Cherry</i>.
They think I am neglecting them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Sir, they are very sorry you
need recruiting; but they are sorry for
themselves too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a very nice Point,” says he musingly,
“when we ought to lie by. I
believe, had I not left Town when I
did, I might have been dead now—and
yet, perhaps I was like a Soldier
deserting his Post.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “No, Sir, you were liker to a
Soldier carried off the Battlefield to
the Hospital.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, <i>Cherry</i>,” says he, taking
my Hand and drawing it under his Arm.
We had now reached the End of the
Bowling-green; but instead of turning
into the Garden, we continued walking
up and down.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“And what else?” says he. “Come,
let me hear all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Sir,” said I, “there’s not much
more to tell——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something, though, I can see!” said
he. “Come! out with it, <i>Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir,” said I, “it’s of no Use for us to
trouble and vex ourselves about what
wicked People will say of us in mere
wantonness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sometimes, though, we may hear the
Truth from an Enemy,” says he. “And
what do wicked, wanton People say
of me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Sir,—some very evil-minded,
malapert Person hath writ on your
Church-door, ‘A Pulpit to Let!’”</p>

<p><span class='small'>The Squire’s Garden</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The Rascal!” said he hastily, and
colouring very red. “Why now, did I
not keep on, Sabbaths and Week-days,
till the Plague-swellings were actually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>in my Throat, though my Congregation
often consisted of only two or
three old Women? Is not this enough
to provoke a Man, <i>Cherry</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Yes, Sir,—only there’s no
Use in being provoked.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“None, none,” says he, much perturbed,—“<span class='sc'>God</span>
forgive me for it!—I can hardly
have Patience, though, with them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Dear Sir, you must have
Nothing <i>but</i> Patience with them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are right, you are right,” says
he, cooling, but still much moved. “Ill
or well, I must go back to them forthwith....
The Fact is, there is a Matter
I would gladly have settled here, a little
at my Leisure.—But, Duty before all!
So, I’ll go back, <i>Cherry</i>, to mine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I smiled a little as I said, “Somebody
has been doing Duty for you, the last
Week or ten Days, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“Who?” cried he.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “An Independent Minister.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A complex Kind of Expression crossed
his Face; for a Moment he looked
pained and provoked, and then burst
out a-laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>God</span> bless the worthy Fellow!” cries
he, “I’ll do him a good Turn if I can, the
first Time he’ll let me! ‘The good
<span class='sc'>Lord</span> accept every one that prepareth
his Heart to seek <span class='sc'>God</span>, the <span class='sc'>Lord God</span>
of his Fathers, even though he be not
cleansed according to the Purification
of the Sanctuary!’—Well, <i>Cherry</i>, I
must go! and that forthwith,—I would
fain have tarried here while your Visit
lasted.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked quite blank at the Idea of
being left behind; and said, “Must I,
then, stay?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” cried he, “what is to prevent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>you? Your Visit is not to <i>me,
Cherry</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Oh, Sir, but ...” and
stopped, for I did not know whether it
were right to say I should feel so lonely
without him. But the Tears came into
my Eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope,” says he, in his kindest Way,
“you will stay and have a very pleasant
Visit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “It won’t,—it can’t be pleasant
now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry</i>,” he said, yet more affectionately,
“we shall soon meet again....
You shake your Head.—Well, our Lives
are not in our own keeping, certainly,
and may be called in the next Minute,
here as well as in <i>London</i>. And I should
not like to die away from my Post. But,
<i>Cherry</i>, since you are inexpressibly dear
to me, and I think I am, in a less Degree,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>dear to you, why, when we meet next,
should we ever part again?—Nay, hear
me, <i>Cherry</i>! for I have long meant to
say this, though not quite so soon....
I thought it would seem so abrupt;
I wanted to bring you to it by Degrees,
lest I should get an Answer I
did not like. For, indeed, <i>Cherry</i>, I
know how much too old I am for
you, how thoroughly unworthy of
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I could not stand this, and cried, “Oh,
how <i>can</i> you say such Things, Sir!
Unworthy of <i>me</i>, indeed! when any
Woman——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Might be proud to have you, was my
Thought, but I did not say it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Cherry</i>,” says he, “there was never——”
And just at that Moment a
Man shouted, “High!” at the Top of his
Voice, and then, “Breakfast!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“We’re keeping them waiting,” said
I, slipping my Hand from his Arm,
“and you’ve left your Papers all blowing
about in the Summer-house.” And
so, ran off to the House.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fain would I not have gone straight to
Breakfast, but there was no Help for it;
and the Squire kept loading my Plate,
and yet saying I ate Nothing. He and
his Lady were wondrous sorry to hear
Master <i>Blower</i> say he must return to
Town the next Day; and looked rather
askance at me for having brought down
any Tidings that should summon him
thither. After Breakfast, however, he
took his Brother aside to explain to him
how needful was his Return to his Parish;
and Mistress <i>Blower</i>, bringing forth an
immense Quantity of Patchwork of very
intricate Contrivance, said, “Now, you
and I will do a good Morning’s Work:”—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>told me it was a Fancy of hers
to furnish a little Bed-chamber with
Patchery, lined with Pink, and fringed
with White. However, Master <i>Blower</i>
put a Check to all this, as far as my Help
went, by coming in and saying that as
this was to be his last Day in the Country,
he wanted to take a long Walk with
me, and shew me the finest View in
the County. Mistress <i>Blower</i> made one
or two Objections, which he summarily
over-ruled; so, in a very few Minutes,
off we were walking together. And first,
without any Reference to what had been
said before Breakfast, he took me round
the Village Green, and into the Church
and Churchyard; and made me look over
the Parsonage Gate. I said, “Dear me,
if I were you, Sir, how much sooner I
would be Parson here than in <i>Whitechapel</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“Would you?” cries he. “Oh, but
this is a very poor Living!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “I did not know you cared
much for Money.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” he said, “not to spend on
myself, but as a Means of Usefulness.
And, oh <i>Cherry</i>! there is so much
Wretchedness in <i>London</i>, that one cannot,
after all, relieve!—I’ll tell you
what I do,” continues he, turning down
a green Lane with me, “as a general
Rule I give away half. That was
<i>Zaccheus’</i> Measure, you know. But, as
a single Man, I have found the other
Half a great deal too much for me, so
I give away all I can of it in Casualties
... just to please myself, as it were.
But I don’t consider this Sub-division
imperative; therefore, when you and
I commence Housekeeping together,
which I hope will be in a <i>very</i> little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>While, we will spend the full Half.
Will that suffice you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No indeed, Sir,” said I, “I shall be
very sorry indeed if I add to your
Expenses so much as that. I would
rather give the Poor another Mouthful
than deprive them of one; and as I
shall only cost you just what I eat and
wear, I hope it won’t make much
Difference.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re a comical Girl,” says he.
“But, <i>Cherry</i>, I’m sorry to say, that
rambling old House of mine is now
so completely out of Repair, as to be
unfit for a Lady’s Occupation. We
must paint it and point it, and mend
the Roof.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, but,” said I, “my Father has
left me six hundred Pounds, which will
do all that very well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Six hundred Pounds!” says he, opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>his Eyes very wide, and then laughing.
“Why, you’ve a Fortune, <i>Cherry</i>! How
could the dear, good Man have saved
it? I thought his Business seemed
quite dwindled away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He had some Money with my
Mother, Sir,” said I. “And an Uncle
left him a Legacy. Besides this
Money, which Master <i>Benskin</i> and
Master <i>Braidfoot</i> pay Interest for, the
House is mine for a long Term; and
<i>Mark</i> means to buy the Business; so
that I hope I shall not be very expensive
to you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” says he, “it will be for After-consideration
whether we repair the
Parsonage at once or not. All shall
be as you wish it, <i>Cherry</i>.” And then
we went on talking of this and that till
we came to a Seat under a Tree; and
there we sat and talked all the Rest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>the Morning; for he did not care much
for going on to see the Prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>After Dinner, it became Master <i>Blower’s</i>
Object to persuade me to name a very
early Day indeed—even that Day Week;
and, though I could hardly endure to
think of so sudden a Change, and thought
it would seem so strange and so unwomanly
to Everybody, yet the main
Thing that wrought upon me was what
I kept to myself; namely, the Danger
he was going to incur in returning to
his Duties before the Infection was over.
And I thought how I should reproach
myself if he fell ill, and died for want
of my Nursing. But then, again, it
would seem so outrageous to the Squire
and his Lady.... Not at all, he said,
they knew all about his wanting to
marry me before ever they sent for me,
and the Squire’s Lady had at first been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>very cool about it; but before we parted
at Night, I had quite won her over;
and she said to him when the Door
closed upon me, “Well, <i>Nat</i>, you may
marry that Girl as soon as you like.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I could hardly help laughing.—What
was I to do? I said, oh, very well, I supposed
they must all have their own Way,—I
would try to be not very miserable
about it. So, when we went in to Supper,
Master <i>Blower</i> made no Secret of what
we had been talking about; and Mistress
<i>Blower</i> kissed me, and so did the Squire,
and we had a wonderful pleasant Supper.
When Master <i>Blower</i> was taking leave of
me, he asked me if I had any Message to
send Home. It then struck me I must
send Word to <i>Mark</i> and <i>Dolly</i> how soon
my Condition was going to be changed,—but,
what could I say?—I had scarce
written a Letter in my Life; least of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>to <i>Mark</i>; and could not for the Life of
me think of any Way of telling him the
News, sufficiently round-about to prevent
its seeming abrupt after all. So, thought
I, least said, soonest mended: and, sitting
down to Pen, Ink, and Paper, I wrote in
my smallest, neatest Hand,—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear <i>Mark</i>,</p>
<p class='c021'>“I’m going to be Mistress <i>Blower</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And sealed it up and directed it. Master
<i>Blower</i> said, “Short, if not sweet!” and
promised it should be faithfully delivered.</p>

<p class='c013'>When he was gone, the Patchwork
was put away, and the Wedding-dresses
sent for. Dear Mistress <i>Blower</i> was as
kind as a Mother to me, though her
Husband was only five Years older than
mine. Indeed she and the Squire looked
upon me quite as a Girl, though I told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>them over and over again I was not.
Though they called each other Father
and Mother, they had never had but one
Child, which died at three Years old;
but I suppose it was always in their
Thoughts.</p>

<p class='c013'>What a happy Week that was!—though
Master <i>Blower</i> was away. On
the Whole, his Absence was a good
Thing: it gave me Time to steady a
little, and feel that it was not a Dream
that I was going to live always within
the Sound of his dear Voice. And, as
there was much Sewing to do, I had
Plenty of Time to think of it. Mistress
<i>Blower</i> gave me my Wedding-clothes,—we
had Post-horses to the old Coach, and
went to buy them at the County Town.
The Gown was white Silk; the Hat
trimmed with a Wreath of very little
pink Roses round the Crown; and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>had a cherry-colour Habit for travelling.
Master <i>Blower</i> said he did not deserve
such a pretty Bride,—but that was his
kind Way of speaking. I only wish I
were better worth his having!</p>

<p class='c013'>—We went away from the Church-door,—as
happy a Bridegroom and Bride
as ever rode a Pillion. When we had
got out of Everybody’s Sight, my Husband
said, “How are you getting on,
Mistress <i>Blower</i>?” I said, “I am
smiling so that I am quite glad there’s
Nobody to see me.” “May the Rest
of your Life be all Smiles and no Tears,
<i>Cherry</i>,” says he,—“with <span class='sc'>God’s</span> Blessing,
it shall be so if I can make it so!”
“Ah!” said I, “I’m content to take the
Rough and the Smooth together, since
I shall henceforth share them with you,
Sir.” “Dearest <i>Cherry</i>,” says he, “you
really must leave off calling me <i>Sir</i>!”</p>

<div id='i279'  class='figcenter id020'>
<img src='images/i279.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“I don’t know that I can, Sir,” said I,
“but I’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Though the Journey was delightsome,
yet towards the latter End of it, every
Mile of the Road became less and less
pleasant, till at length we got into the
Tide of People, on Horse and on Foot,
setting in towards <i>London</i>. Then, how
strange it seemed to me that I was not
going back to the Bridge! where I had
lived all the Days of my Life till within
the last Week! I began to tremble a
little; and the Idea of the great old
roomy, gloomy House in <i>Whitechapel</i>,
with no bright, sparkling Water to look
out upon, became rather oppressive to
me, till I thought how Master <i>Blower’s</i>
continual Presence would light it up.
The Streets now becoming thronged, he
pressed my Arm tighter to him and bade
me hold on close; and I felt he was all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>the World to me, be the House what
it would. But when we reached it,
what a Difference! The whole Front
had a fresh Coat of Paint, which made
it wondrous lightsome and cheerful; the
Door-step was fresh whitened, the Door
fresh varnished, the Knocker fresh
polished, and Mistress <i>Peach</i> standing
on the Step with a new Cap plaited
close round her sweet, pleasant Face,
and dressed in a new grass-green Gown.
I could not help kissing her as I ran in;
she said, “<span class='sc'>God</span> bless you, Mistress!”
with hearty Cordiality, and followed me
from Room to Room. Everything had
been cleaned up, and she told me, laughing,
that though she had had Plenty of
Helps, it had been the hardest Week’s
Work she had ever had in her Life.
The old green Bed-furniture had given
Place to new white Dimity; there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>a Lady’s Pincushion on the Toilette, with
“May you be happy!” in minikin Pins;
and a Beau-pot of Flowers on the Window-seat.
“All that is Mistress <i>Violet’s</i>
doing,” said <i>Dorcas</i>; “she has not left
the House half an Hour, I assure you,
and her Needle went in and out as fast
as could be when she was finishing the
last Muslin Blind. Oh, she has been
very busy, has Mistress <i>Violet</i>! ’Twas
she set out the Supper Table with the
Flowers, and Sweet-meats, and Pound-cake.”</p>

NEXT Day, the Holiday of
Life was over, its Duties
re-commenced. Master
<i>Blower</i> had an Accumulation
of Business to attend
to, and I had Plenty to do about the
House. Before the End of the Week, I
was immersed in Cares that were Pleasures
to me, inasmuch as they lightened
his own. But I could not resist paying
a Visit to the Bridge, and spending an
Hour in the dear old House, and another,
afterwards, with <i>Violet</i>. She and <i>Mark</i>
came to sup with us. I found they were
not going to marry till six Months were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>out, which was full quick, after all; but
I was thankful they would wait so long.
A Change seemed coming over <i>Mark</i>;
he was steady, composed, attentive to
Business, and far pleasanter, whether
lively or sad, than in his earlier Days.
As to <i>Violet</i>, she was infinitely softened,
and the old Spirit of Coquetry seemed
quite to have burned out. We did not
see them often, but Master <i>Blower</i> always
received them kindly, and they seemed
to consider it a Privilege as well as a
Pleasure to come to us.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus, the Winter wore on: the Plague
was stayed; and though it was common
to meet in the Streets Men in their
Nightcaps, limping, or with their Throats
bound up, no one thought of getting out
of their Way, for the Infection had spent
itself. And Persons that were Strangers
to each other might be heard exchanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Congratulations on the improved State
of Things, now that Houses and Shops
were re-opening, the Weeds beginning
to disappear from the Thoroughfares,
and Men no longer walked along the
Middle of the Streets, but on the Foot-pavements.</p>

<p class='c013'>My dear Husband endeavoured to impress
the Hearts and Minds of his People,
in Season and out of Season, with a Sense
of the Mercy that had preserved them;
but, I am sorry to say, with very little
permanent Effect. True it is, at first
the Ground was broken up, and the Clods
were soft, and the good Seed that was
cast in seemed likely to fructify; but
alas, the hot Sun of worldly Temptation
soon hardened the Ground and burnt the
Seed up, and People that had almost
miraculously escaped the general Judgment,
seemed little better than they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>were before. This depressed my dear
Husband very much; but, instead of
relaxing his Efforts, he only redoubled
them; and he said I strengthened his
Hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was also a great deal of Distress,
owing to the general Stagnation of Trade,
and the vast Numbers of People thrown
out of Employ. So that, though we
did all we could, it was heart-rending
to witness the Misery in some of the
lower Districts of our Parish. We
pinched ourselves to help them, voluntarily
giving up such and such Things
at our Table; and this with such Cheerfulness
that I really believe our Self-privations
gave us more actual Enjoyment
than if we had ate the Fat and
drank the Sweet to our Hearts’ Desire.
And once or twice it remarkably happened
that when we had a little exceeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>in this Way, and had supplied thereby
the needs of a more than ordinary Number,
a great Hamper would arrive from
Mistress <i>Blower</i>, full of Game, Poultry,
Eggs, Butter, Brawn, Hams, Tongues,
and Everything that was good. Often
we talked over that sweet Place the
Hampers came from; and it seemed to
me that my Husband more and more
inclined towards the Country; especially
as his Throat had never quite recovered
the Effects of the Plague, and he found
he could not make himself heard throughout
the remoter Parts of his large Church
without Difficulty. Quite at the End
of the Summer, the old Incumbent of
<i>Bucklands</i> Parsonage died; and as the
living was in the Squire’s Gift, and he
had some Notion his Brother would like
it, he wrote to offer it to him. My
Husband asked my Mind about it; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>said I should like it of all Things, if he
could be content with so small and quiet
a Field of Action. He said, yes, the
Time had been when it had been otherwise
with him—the harder the Work
the greater the Pleasure, especially as
carrying some Sense of Glory in the
Victory over it; but it was not so with
him now: he could be content with
trying to do good on a small Scale;
especially as he had not been quite so
successful on the larger Field of Action
as he had hoped and expected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Could I preach like <i>Apollos</i>,” continued
he, “to what Good, to the Half
of my Congregation, who cannot catch
one Word in ten? So that, in Fact, I
preach to a small Congregation already.
And I’ve no Mind to receive the Pay
without doing the Work. There’s no
Fear, <i>Cherry</i>, of my not making myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>audible in <i>Bucklands</i> Church!—Besides,
do you know I fancy I have a little
domestic Mission there. My dear,
good Brother, who has dozed under
Doctor <i>Bray</i> for so many Years, has
languished under a spiritual Dearth.
He is now getting in Years, and I
think I may do Something for him—you
know he told you he thought my
Sermons were <i>the real Thing</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He said,” replied I, “that you not
only hit the right Nail on the Head,
but hammered it well in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After some further Talk, which only
went to prove how completely we were
of a Mind on the Matter, the Letters
were written and sent—to accept the one
Living and resign the other. That was
on the Second of <i>September</i>. The same
Night, broke out that dreadful Fire,
which lasted three Days and three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Nights, and destroyed fifteen of the
twenty-six City Wards, including four
hundred Streets and Lanes, and thirteen
thousand Houses. Oh, what a dreadful
Calamity! We were in Bed, a little
after Ten, when Shrieks and Cries of
“Fire!” awoke us; and my dear Husband
put his Head forth of the Window
and asked where it was. A Man running
along answered, “On or at the Foot of
<i>London Bridge</i>!” Then our Hearts
failed us for <i>Violet</i> and <i>Mark</i>, and all our
old Friends; and we dressed and went
forth, for I could not be stayed from
accompanying Master <i>Blower</i>. But before
we could reach the Bridge Foot, we
found Access to it cut off, both by Reason
of the Crowd and of the Flames: the
only Comfort was, that the Fire kept off
the Bridge. There was so much Tumult
and Pressure that we could only keep on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the Skirts of the Crowd, where we hung
about without doing any Good for some
Hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next Morning, we were in Hope
of hearing the Fire had been got under;
instead of which, the whole <i>Bankside</i> was
wrapped in Flames, and all the Houses
from the Bridge Foot, and all <i>Thames
Street</i>, were lying in Ashes. The People
seemed all at Pause, gazing on, without
stirring Hand or Foot, and those that
were personal Sufferers were venting their
Grief in Cries and Lamentations. But
we could not find that any Life had yet
been lost; and the Fire kept off the
Bridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I went Home at Dusk, it was
to pray for the poor Sufferers, and then
to muse how far the Calamity might
extend. Supper was on Table, but I
had no Mind to eat; which was all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>better, as my Husband presently brought
in a poor, weeping Family who had lost
Everything, and had not touched a Morsel
all Day. We gave them a good Meal,
and Shelter for the Night. They slept,
but we could not. There was no Need
of Candles all that Night, which was as
light as Day for ten Miles round. The
Fire was now spreading all along the
South Part of the City, leaping from
House to House, and Street to Street, for
the very Air seemed ignited; Showers of
Sparks and Ashes were falling in every
Direction, and the Pavement was growing
almost too hot to tread upon. My
Husband kept bringing in new Refugees
as long as our House would hold them,
and I was too busy caring for them to
have Leisure to go forth, even had it
been safe; but each New-comer brought
fresh Tidings of the Desolation, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>was now extending to Churches, public
Monuments, Hospitals, Companies’ Halls,
as though it would carry all before it.
We now began to be in some Alarm
for ourselves; and to consider what we
should do if it came our Way; and now
we experienced the Convenience of having
but little Treasure that Moth, Rust,
or Fire could injure, for when Master
<i>Blower</i> had made up a small Packet of
Papers and ready Money that we could
readily carry about us, there was Nothing
left for the Destroyer to consume but our
poor Furniture and the House over our
Heads. Very opportunely, at this Time
came to our Door a <i>Berkshire</i> Countryman
with one of the good Squire’s
Hampers full of Eatables. I never saw
a poor Fellow look so scared! He got
a good View of the Calamity from a Distance,
and then set his Face homewards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>in as great a Hurry as if the Flames
were in Chase of him. The Streets were
now full of Carts loaded with Moveables,
which their Owners were conveying out
of Town; giving Way to the Calamity
rather than seeking to arrest it, which,
indeed, it was now vain to attempt,
though I think Something might have
been done at first. <i>St. Paul’s</i> was now
in a Blaze; the great Stones exploding
with intense Heat, and the melted Lead
running along the Gutters. This Night,
also, we got scarce any Rest.</p>

<div id='i294'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i294.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>S<sup>t</sup> Paul’s was now in a Blaze</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The next Morning, while I was overlooking
my Stores, and considering how I
should best husband them for my poor Inmates,
in comes <i>Mark</i>, his Face blackened,
his Hair full of Ashes, his Clothes singed
in many Places, and his Shoes nearly
burnt off his Feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank <span class='sc'>God</span>, you are safe, then!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>cries he, catching hold of both my Hands.
“The Sky looked so fiery in this Quarter
during the Night, that <i>Violet</i> and I were
in dreadful Fear for you, and I started
at Daybreak, and came here by making
a great Round, to see how it fared with
you. And <i>Violet</i> bids me say that she
has not forgotten your Father’s and
Mother’s Kindness to her Father and
Mother when they were burned out of
House and Home, nor how she and you
were put together in the same Cradle;
and it will make her and me, dear
<i>Cherry</i>, unspeakably happy to receive
you and Master <i>Blower</i> under the very
same Roof, should you be burnt out of
your own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said, “Dear <i>Mark</i>, that is so like
you and <i>Violet</i>! Just the Kindness I
should have expected! Believe me,
we shall thankfully accept it, if there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>be Need. But at present the Fire is
all about us, yet comes not to us. We
have made up our little Parcel of Treasures,
(a little one, indeed, <i>Mark</i>!) and
are ready to start at a Minute’s Notice,
trusting to a good <span class='sc'>God</span> to spare our
Lives. This old House, if it once
catches, will burn like Tinder; meanwhile,
come and see how many it
holds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I led him from Room to Room,
and shewed him Mothers nursing their
Infants, Children eating Bread and
Milk, and old People still sleeping
heavily. He was greatly interested and
impressed. “What a good Soul you
are!” said he,—“I can give you no
Notion of the Scenes of Misery on
the Outskirts through which I passed
on my Way here. People huddled in
Tents, or lying under Hedges, or on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Heaps of Litter and broken Furniture,
without a Morsel of Bread or a Cup
of Milk, yet none begging!... I
saw a few Bread-carts and Milk-people
coming up to them as I passed along,
but many had no Money, not even a
Penny, to buy a Breakfast. I had
filled my Purse, <i>Cherry</i>, with all that
was in the Till, before I set out;
but you see there’s not much in it
now——”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he pulled out an empty Purse,
with a Smile that showed he was well
pleased with the Way its Contents had
gone. Then we shook Hands heartily,
and parted.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the loud Crackling of Flames and
Crash of falling Buildings, was now
added the blowing up of Houses with
Gunpowder, which, indeed, made the
Neighbourhood of them very dangerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>to Bystanders, but checked the Progress
of the Fire. However, Nothing effectual
could have been done, had it not
pleased <span class='sc'>Almighty God</span> to stay his Judgment
by abating the high Wind, which
fell all at once; whereby the Flames
ceased to spread, though the glowing
Ruins continued to burn.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Crisis being now past, we ceased
to be in Apprehension for ourselves, and
devoted all our Attention to the poor,
bereft People under our Care. Some
of these were fetched away by their
Country Friends; sooner or later all
dispersed; and then we went out into
the Fields adjoining the City, to afford
what little Help we could. But oh!
the Desolation! To attempt to assuage
that Accumulation of Destitution by our
trivial Means seemed like essaying to
subdue the Fire with a Cup of Water:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>yet we know that every Little helps;
and that even a Cup of Water, to the
thirsty Man who drinks it, quenches
not his Thirst the less, that Thousands
beside are parched with Drought. And
thus, by Analogy, concerning the general
Amount of human Suffering surrounding
us at all Times, which the wife of
a <i>Whitechapel</i> Parson is perhaps as well
qualified to speak of as any one else—We
need not be discouraged from aiding
any, because we cannot succour all;
since the Relief afforded is as grateful
to him who has it, as though <i>all</i>
were relieved, which it is not <span class='sc'>God’s</span>
Will that any should have Power to
accomplish.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the End of the Month this
terrible Calamity was over-past; at least,
as far as we had Anything to do with
it, though we continued to give Shelter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>to poor, ruined Householders as long
as the Parsonage was our own. The
Gentleman who succeeded my dear Husband
seemed a benevolent Sort of Man,
a little pompous, maybe, but tenderly
disposed towards the Poor.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now, Everything being settled,
we sold some of our old Furniture, and
sent down the Rest, with Mistress <i>Peach</i>,
by the Wagon. And my dear Husband
and I entered <i>Bucklands</i> exactly as we
had left it, and on the very same Horse;
I in my cherry-colour Habit, that was
as fresh as on my Wedding-day. And
here we have been ever since; and he
calls me his right Hand, and says my
Attention to all his secular Affairs leaves
his Mind at Liberty to pursue his Duties
and Studies without Distraction—and
that I understand the Poor even better
than he does—and that I am his best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Counsellor, his dearest Friend, his pleasantest
Companion, his darling <i>Cherry</i>!—Yes;
he calls me, and I believe he
thinks me all this: and as for <i>my</i> being
happy in <i>him</i> ... I should think so,
indeed!</p>
